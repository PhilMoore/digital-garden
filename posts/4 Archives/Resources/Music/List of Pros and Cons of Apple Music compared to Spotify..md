# List of Pros and Cons of Apple Music compared to Spotify.

## Pros
-   Can download songs individually.
-   Has a dedicated page to manage downloaded music.
-   Better library management (though this is really subjective)
-   Smart Playlists  
    _Allows you to create dynamic playlist that can contain multiple conditions, i.e. a playlist that only shows music for a specific artist in your library. If you add more songs to your library that meets that condition, they playlist gets updated automatically._  
    _Can be created on the desktop and iTunes._
-   Shortcuts to do various things, i.e play a specific playlist at a certain time.
-   I could be capping, but the algorithm used to recommend music learns "faster".
-   Support for **Lossless**.
-   Supports Dolby Atmos.
-   Supports both **Dark** and **Light** themes.
-   **Lyrics** UI looks and functions better.
-   Overall UI looks and feels nicer.
-   Some albums have some background information about the record.  
    _This is formatted really bad though. It just looks like a wall of text._

-   Has **Music Videos**.
-   Has **City Charts**, playlists that have the top 25 track in certain cities.
-   Depending on how you feel about it, it doesn't have podcasts.  
    _Podcasts are aggressively pushed on Spotify. The listening experience is fine, but Spotify lacks a lot of features for podcasts._
-   Doesn't have the A/B testing of Spotify.  
    _Spotify has this thing where they randomly give access to new/beta features to random users. This can cause the experience for users differ considerably._
-   Animated playlists and album art.
-   Radio stations.
-   Dedicated page for Record Labels
-   Artist interviews.
-   Pays artists more.


## Cons
-   No universal connect feature.  
    _Connect is a feature where you can listen on one device and seamlessly switch to listening on another device. It also allows you to use your devices as remotes._
-   Cannot search in playlists.
-   Cannot sort in playlists.
-   Music take so long to start streaming at times.  
    _I'm not sure what causes this, it sometimes starts instantly then other time songs don't load. Compared to Spotify, this is horrific. Spotify starts streaming instantly and even caches upcoming songs in advance._
-   Can't download entire library at once.  
    _This option is available on the iOS app, but not Android. Allegedly only works for newly added songs to library._
-   Can't follow artists to get release updates.
-   Can't follow record labels to get release updates.
-   Can't follow Shows/Stations.
-   Can't organise playlists or anything in your library into folders.  
    _This is false. It's possible on desktop. Like Spotify, the option is missing on mobile._  
    _The experience isn't as smooth as Spotify._
-   Followed/Apple Music playlists aren't separated from personal playlists like in iTunes.
-   Queue is pretty lackluster. (Can't queue songs in succession.)  
    _They removed the Play Later queue option for some reason._
-   Cannot easily manage **playlist songs** (i.e can't quickly delete them)  
    _This is however possible when the song is already in your library._
-   Doesn't have a Credits section for tracks.
-   Does not recommend songs for a playlist at the bottom of said playlist.
-   Can't see if both shuffle and repeat is on from the **Now Playing** screen.
-   When searching for Playlists, Apple Music will show their curated playlists in the results even if they're not related to what you searched.  
    _For some reason there are a lot of classical music in the search results, regardless of what you search._
-   Community playlists are severely lacking, especially true for niche genres.
-   No Linux client.
-   No Android TV client.
-   No dedicated Apple Music app for Windows — iTunes experience feels extremely outdated.
-   Web app is really sluggish to say the very least.
-   macOS client is really lacking as well. _I can't verify this personally, but a lot of commenters on reddit has said this._
-   No ability to pin playlists, or anything for that matter.
-   Lacks "Smart" downloads — the app does a "fresh" download of a song that I just streamed in the same quality.  
    _In Spotify, if you download a song you just listened to at Very High quality and Download quality is also to Very High quality, it doesn't redownload the song._
-   Can't set a quality lower than 256kbps for streaming.  
    _This is minor and doesn't bother me personally, but in places where Internet speeds are trash, this might be off putting. Couple this with the app's stream load times in general, it can't be a good experience._
-   Extremely limited Mixes / Personal Recommendations.
-   No Discord integration  
    _This might seem like a dumb con to some people, but with the music bots no longer working, it's really convenient being able to drop a Spotify thing in a Discord and having friends listen along. Especially when an artist we all listen to dropped a new record._
-   No ability to collaborate on playlists.
-   Doesn't really have any social features.
-   Library can get a bit cluttered when adding a lot of songs as Apple Music adds everything related to that song to your library - Album, Artist, Genre, etc.
-   If a song features more than one artist, you can only view the artist page of the main artist.
-   Yearly Replay lacks compared to Wrapped.  
    _It's better to use a service like LastFM to track your listening habits._
-   Doesn't show monlthy listeners on artist profiles.  
    _This is not really a con, but a lot of people like looking at these numbers._
-   There is no **Don't play this** option on artist profiles.
-   The **Love** and **Dislike** buttons don't do anything.
