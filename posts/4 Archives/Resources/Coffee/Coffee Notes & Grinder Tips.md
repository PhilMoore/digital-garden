### Grinder Setting - Commandante C40

Try these settings from 0

Espresso 14-15

Aeropress 18-20

V60 24-26

Chemex 28-30

French Press 32-34

Cupping 35

Everytime you go finer or coarser in the dial, you apply a certain amount of force. You will get to the “0 setting” once the force you find that turning the handle requires force to turn instead of turning freely.

Can also try 12 now for espresso (24 if you have the Red Clix RX35 installed). It can be because the grinds burrs become dull after so many uses, so you need to grind finer and finer as it happens with commercial grinder burrs.

_If you you go to the Commandante Grinder FAQ, they have a list of recommended grind settings_

Whilst the perfect grind setting of course varies from coffee to coffee, here are some good starting points for you:

-   5–10 Clicks for Ibrik.
-   10–15 Clicks for Espresso.
-   15–20 Clicks for a Bialetti or stovetop coffee pot.
-   22–32 Clicks for a pour over filter coffee (depending on dose and brewer).
-   25–-30 Clicks for Cupping and French Press.
-   30–35 Clicks for a Karlsbad Coffee Maker.
-   Aeropress? Well, that depends on your recipe ;)!


## Storing coffee tips

It’s fine to freeze whole beans for up to a month, provided you’re not taking them out during that period. “For a large amount of coffee, first divide it into smaller portions, then freeze the portions in airtight bags,” recommends Robert Nelson, president and chief executive officer of the National Coffee Association. When you do remove the frozen beans, put them on a shelf to thaw, and grind and brew within two weeks so the coffee is truly good to the last drop.


### Taking coffee fee out of the freezer

When you pull the beans out, allow them to thaw to room temperature completely before opening the container. If you open the container prematurely, you’ll get that nasty, coffee killing condensation.
