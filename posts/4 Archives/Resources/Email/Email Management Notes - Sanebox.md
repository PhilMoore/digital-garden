# Day 1 | The Scan-Block-Ask system
Welcome to the first lesson of Inbox Zero Academy! We’re thrilled to have you here and can’t wait to help you bring sanity to your email life. By the end of this course, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to get your inbox under control, and to get the most out of the email you send. We’re going to start strong today with a game-changing process used by the most efficient emailers out there, _our three-step Scan-Block-Ask system:_


## Step 1: Scan
_Scan_ your inbox for emails with urgent and important items, and take care of them first thing in the morning. Then, close your email and work on your top priorities.


## Step 2: Block
_Block_ 30 to 60 minutes later in the day to process your non-urgent and less important emails. Having a set time in your calendar will help you stay focused on your tasks and ensures that you won’t miss or forget about emails.


## Step 3: Ask
_Ask_ yourself if clearing your Inbox is the best use of time right now. Do this every time you are in your email and every time you think about opening your email. If the answer is no, wait until the next block of time that you scheduled for email.


## Action Steps:
This is one of the hardest lesson in this program (I know, /“and they spring this on me day 1…really?”/) because it’s asking you to make new habits and break old ones. To make it easier, do a practice run with the Scan-Block-Ask system the next time you open your inbox, and don’t forget to add blocks of time for email into your calendar!


# Day 2 | Triage your inbox

Yesterday we learned that the best emailers think about their inboxes differently. They also manage them differently, and that brings us to today’s main focus—how to process email in a fraction of the time.

When “doing email” is your main focus, you’re letting other people dictate your priorities! Stop hitting refresh repeatedly in your inbox, and instead save hours of time (and sanity) with email triage.


## A brief history lesson
Triage

Noun, trē-’äzh

Developed during the Napoleonic Wars by Dominique Jean Larrey, triage is a way to determine the priority of a patient’s treatment based on his condition. The beginning of the word, “tri,” can help you remember that there are three categories a patient can fall into:
-   _Those who are likely to die, regardless of what care they receive_
-   _Those who are likely to live, regardless of what care they receive_
-   _Those for whom immediate care might make a positive difference in outcome_ So how does this apply to email? Let’s combine the triage method with the options you have with each new email:

1.  Emails that are a lost cause → Delete or archive

These are the emails (patients) for which there is no hope and, therefore, are not the best use of your time.

If you can tell by the subject line and sender that an email is not important, just delete or archive it without opening. If you know that you will never need to reference the email in the future, delete it. If you aren’t sure or know you will need it, archive it. Whenever possible, process these messages in bulk (we can help with that!).

1.  Emails that can be quickly addressed → Defer, delegate, or respond

These emails can be managed quickly with the likelihood of a positive outcome.

Defer: If an email is not urgent until later, people tend to leave it in their inbox. This causes you to look at it (i.e. spend time and focus on it) over and over. A much better way is to move it out of your inbox until you’re ready to deal with it. We have quick and easy snooze options for this, but you can also create custom folders (for days of the week, say) to help you stay organized.

Delegate: If someone on your team can deal with one of your emails, by all means, forward it on.

Respond: If an email is really urgent, or if a response will take under two minutes, then reply right away. Don’t waste time thinking about what to do with it.

1.  Emails that need work → Do

These emails need your time and energy in order for a positive outcome to occur.

This final bucket consists of the emails that require you to do work. The best practice power email users follow is to move those emails into a separate folder. Gmail provides the easiest option: Star, then archive that email. Then you simply work out of your Starred folder. In other email interfaces, you can either flag those emails, or move them into a Work folder. This way your inbox is truly dedicated only to new, unprocessed emails.

Alternatively, you can choose to keep the “Do” emails in your inbox. If you are diligent with the steps 1 and 2, the only inbox are the ones you will work on and process today. The rest will have either died (sadface), been bandaged up quickly, or deferred for non-emergency surgery.

To recap, here is the playbook

1.  Noise (should die) → Delete or archive
2.  Quick fix (~2 min) → Defer, delegate, or respond
3.  Urgent (needs real work) → Do today


## Action Steps
Triage your inbox for the first time. Do it swiftly and with purpose, remembering that your time is valuable and you can only treat so many patients. Which ones can you save and deserve it?


# Day 3 | Turn off all email notifications

Welcome back for day three! Yesterday we discussed how to triage your inbox, an efficient way to distinguish between urgent and important tasks that saves tons of time and allows you to get real stuff done on your to-do lists!

_Today we are going to show you how to overcome the #1 productivity killer, email notifications._

When you let every email that arrives in your inbox to interrupt you, you destroy your productivity. This is why we set up dedicated blocks of time to check email (remember lesson one!), and this is also why we need to turn off email notifications.

Studies have shown that every time we are interrupted by events like an email notification, it takes us 90 seconds to recover and return to the task at hand. Considering that the average person manages over 100 emails per day, this really adds up! What’s more, 40% of the time when we are interrupted, we fail to complete the interrupted task.

We cannot belabor this point enough—to regain and maintain your focus, turn off notifications everywhere you receive email, including on your smartphone, tablet, and computer. If you’re really ready to take it to the next level, remove the email app from your phone entirely.

Tim Ferris said it best, _“Get off the cocaine pellet dispenser and focus on execution of your top to-do’s instead of responding to manufactured emergencies!”_


## Action steps
Turn off all email notifications, including badge app icons, banners, and pop-up alerts. Bonus points for turning off other distracting notifications like those from social networking apps! For more details on how to turn off notifications on your mobile device,

# Day 4 | Treat your inbox right

Today’s lesson is a three-part series that covers how to treat your inbox right. In it, we’ll cover:

1.  How to properly filter your bacn (no, not the delicious breakfast delight we love so much);
2.  Why we shouldn’t always default to emailing;
3.  Why you should stop using your inbox as an archive.


## Properly filter your bacn
Spam has largely been solved, but the new evil is bacn (pronounced “bacon”). These are legitimate emails (e.g. newsletters and social media alerts) that you have subscribed to and possibly want to see, but they don’t deserve to interrupt your day. It’s best to make sure these messages never set foot in your inbox by filtering them out. At minimum, be sure to process these messages in bulk so they don’t waste your time or linger in your inbox.

If you’re already using

[SaneBox](https://www.sanebox.com/) or have another filtering system for your bacn, then kudos to you for maximizing efficiency! If not, don’t worry—we’ll dive deeper into this in later lessons.


## Don’t always email
As we’re sure you know, email threads can quickly balloon into dozens of messages and numerous recipients. That simple “Plans this Friday” subject line really did some damage to your inbox, huh? Or how about the email exchange with 7 colleagues that went on for days. Before continuing the thread and adding to the inbox madness, decide if:

-   a) A phone conference is better;
-   b) Some people should be removed from the thread;
-   c) It makes sense to start a new thread altogether.


## Don’t use your inbox as an archive
Using your Inbox as an archive goes against every productivity method out there; this is the number one faux pas, people! It’s the equivalent of stuffing your snail mail back into your mailbox after reading it. It’s terrible for your productivity, and for your subconscious. Don’t do it. Instead, utilize your email’s search function to find messages and create folders for various categories of emails you may need to reference in the future.


## Action steps
1.  Bulk process all of the bacn in your inbox.
2.  Each time you go to send an email today, ask yourself if a phone call, text message, or instant message would be more efficient.
3.  Scan your inbox and organize the important emails that you’ve already read, but have allowed to remain in your inbox.


# Day 5 | Use the subject line wisely
You’d be surprised how many people just scan subject lines and delete emails that don’t seem relevant to them. And we can hardly blame them—this is exactly what we ask you to do when triaging your inbox and using the Scan-Block-Ask system.

To make sure that your emails are opened and responded to correctly, there are a couple of things you can do. First, try putting a call to action right in the subject line. “5 things I need you to do tomorrow” is much more clear than “Things” and it also makes searching for older email easier. Next, consider adding one of the following to make your emails relevant and actionable:

-   _[Time Sensitive]_: Help the recipient triage her inbox by saying this is an urgent and important email.
-   _[Action Item]_: Tell your recipient that something is needed from him.
-   _[Not Urgent]_: By adding this to the subject line, you’re removing a lot of pressure from the recipient.
-   _[Please reply by (date)]_: Consider adding a deadline to eliminate uncertainty and avoid receiving an extra email asking when action is needed by.
-   _[NNTR, NRN or FYI]_: These are short for “No Need to Reply,” “No Response Necessary” and “For Your Information.” Put one at the end of the subject line to save the recipient from writing an unnecessary email (and to save yourself from reading an unnecessary reply).
-   _[EOM]_: If you can fit the entire message into a subject line, put EOM (End of Message) at the end to tell the recipient s/he doesn’t even need to open the email. By including one or more of the above in your subject line, you will avoid unnecessary email exchanges, making life better for you and for the other person.


## Action steps

# Day 6 | Proper email etiquette

Our lesson today covers basic email etiquette. When followed, you will not only be better seen in the eyes of the recipient, but also will save all parties unnecessary time and headaches.

### Here are the main pieces of email etiquette to keep in mind:

1.  Don’t end a long email with “Thoughts?” or any other open-ended question. Instead, be specific. Say “Do you think we should do X, Y or Z?”
2.  If you’re writing an email that has action items, list them first, followed by the content. Most people reverse this process. By adding the action steps first, you are effectively giving the reader context to the action items, which allows them to construct a plan of attack before they are even done reading the email.
3.  Another pro tip is that if your email is on the longer side, highlight key words or sentences in _bold_. This will make their job easier and you’ll be a more efficient communicator. Don’t do all caps (THAT’S YELLING!) and don’t bold too much–it will lose its impact.
4.  Avoid using images in your signature. They show up as attachments in many email clients and only serve to clutter and confuse the message.
5.  Double check to make sure you were CC’d, not BCC’d, before replying to everyone on a thread. If you were BCC’d, then only you and the sender know that you were included on the email; by hitting ‘Reply All,’ the secret is out!
6.  To avoid accidentally sending too soon, add the recipient’s email address after you are done composing the message and the subject line.


## Action steps
Use at least one of these email hacks in the next email you write, and tell us your biggest email pet peeve in the comments box below.


# Day 7 | An unhackable, but easy to remember password

Most people don’t realize how vulnerable their email accounts are to cyber threats, which can lead to a staggering number of problems. Some of our most sensitive information is stored in our email account; imagine what an imposter would find if they got ahold of your password, not to mention all of the spam you could end up with. That would certainly be counterproductive to Inbox Zero. Today we will show you the proper steps to padlock your security.

Coming up with an unhackable password that you can actually remember is easier than you think. To start, think of a phrase (like a refrain from a song or a sentence you remember by heart) and make the first letters of every word your password.

For example, if you’re a big Michael Jackson fan, then “Billy Jean is not my lover, she’s just a girl who claims that I am the one” can become bjinmlsjagwctiat1, a 17-character password that’s near-impossible to guess but easy to remember. Note, however, that it’s critical that you never use the same password for multiple services. This way, if one of them is compromised, others are safe!

Real techies use

[1Password](https://www.sanebox.com/l/inbox-zero-academy-day-7/#) or
[LastPass](https://www.sanebox.com/l/inbox-zero-academy-day-7/#) . These services randomly generate and securely store unique passwords for each of your logins. Since this info is stored locally, the passwords are nearly impossible for hackers to access. And if you use multiple devices, you can sync the file via Dropbox (just make sure to have a really strong password for your Dropbox!).

P.S. We also recommend that you enable two-factor authentication on apps and sites with sensitive information. For a comprehensive list, click here:
[https://twofactorauth.org/](https://twofactorauth.org/)


## Action steps
-   Set up two-factor authentication for your important apps if you have not already.
-   Look into 1Password or LastPass to see which password manager is right for you.
-   Change duplicate passwords that you use on multiple sites, particularly if those sites contain sensitive personal or financial information.


# Day 8 | Don’t unsubscribe from suspicious emails

Unsubscribing from suspicious emails can result in more junk mail because you’re exposing yourself as a real person (who actually reads emails) to a potential spammer. Fortunately, there are ways to silence annoying emails without clicking the unsubscribe link, which may or may not be legitimate.

As spammers became smarter about how they found out if an email address is real and active, services and tools arose in order to help people safely unsubscribe. There are a few options out there (including one from yours truly!), and most work in a similar way. Essentially, you mark any sender you don’t want to receive future emails from, and then all subsequent messages from that sender will be sent directly to the trash. This really is the best of both worlds, because you get rid of the emails you don’t want, but without clicking any links or leaving your email to unsubscribe on another site.


## 3 reasons this is a better way to unsubscribe
1.  It’s faster
It’s far more efficient to drag and drop an email or click around within your email than to go through the arduous and intentionally difficult unsubscribe process. There are no new windows to open, no fields to fill out, and no check boxes to mark.

2.  It’s rewarding
Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is more rewarding than banishing an irritating sender into email abyss, never to be heard from or seen again!

3.  It’s safer
As we mentioned above, unsubscribing from suspicious emails is risky. Your success really depends on the integrity of the sender. There are plenty of examples where unsubscribing from suspicious emails actually results in WAY more junk mail because you unknowingly exposed yourself to more spammy mailing lists.

# Day 9 | The best follow-up reminders

Yesterday we put an end to the vicious cycle of being unable to opt out of emails. Luckily, there are tools that can save from us from this injustice, tools such as

[SaneBlackHole](https://www.sanebox.com/l/one_click_unsusbcribe) and

[Unroll.me](http://unroll.me/) . Next on our awesome email agenda? Using reminders to make sure we never forget to follow up on unanswered emails.

Given how many emails the average person sends and receives per day, it can be hard to keep track of everything. People don’t respond, we forget to follow up, and important items just fall through the cracks. Today’s focus is one of our favorite power hacks: Stop waiting on responses, and instead systematize your workflow using reminders.

Without further adieu, say goodbye to sticky notes and tedious online calendar entries, and hello to convenient and reliable email reminders.


## 3 ways to track if someone doesn’t reply to you

### Yesware
Yesware’s reminder feature is an exceptional tool, particularly for those in sales, which is the company’s main niche target. When sending an email, you can set a date and time for a reminder alert to come back into your inbox if the recipient hasn’t gotten back to you. You can do this from within the email view itself and also through your Yesware dashboard. When the alert pops into your inbox to let you know you didn’t receive a reply, it will include the original outgoing message and also stats like how many times the sent message was opened. [Yesware](http://www.yesware.com/blog/help/how-to/reminder-feature/)


### Boomerang for Gmail
Gmail users can use this handy extension to remove email threads from their inbox until they need them. To utilize this when composing a message, just use the extension to enter the date and time you want to see it again and it will be archived until that time. Depending on your preference, you can have the returning email be marked as unread, starred, or placed at the top of your inbox. (Power tip: The extension also allows you to compose messages and schedule them to be sent in the future.) [Boomeranggmail](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/l/email-reminders.html)


### SaneBox
SaneBox offers two solutions for follow-up tracking:
[SaneReminders](https://www.sanebox.com/learn/sanereminders) and
[SaneNoReplies](https://www.sanebox.com/sanenoreplies) . SaneReminders works in a similar way to Yesware and Boomerang, except instead of entering or clicking on a date and time for the reminder, you simply send the email as usual and CC or BCC a reminder address like
[tomorrow@sanebox.com](https://mailto:tomorrow@sanebox.com) or
[friday.1pm@sanebox.com](https://mailto:friday.1pm@sanebox.com) or
[december31@sanebox.com](https://mailto:december31@sanebox.com) . You can also customize the CC or BCC address to have the email come back to your inbox even if you do receive a response.

_Example:_
Send an email To:
[my-milk-man@deliveries.com](https://mailto:my-milk-man@deliveries.com) and BCC:
[Monday.10am@sanebox.com](https://mailto:Monday.10am@sanebox.com) . If the milkman doesn’t reply by Monday at 10am to confirm that day’s delivery, the sent email will go back into your inbox so you can easily re-send or reply to it and make sure you get your milk.

If you want to create a reminder for yourself that doesn’t have anything to do with an outgoing email, you can use SaneReminders for that, too. Just email the note and any details to a reminder address. For instance, if I need to pay a bill, book a hotel room, or buy a birthday card, I can schedule a reminder to show up in my inbox on the right day. You can even set up daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly reminders for recurring events and tasks.

The other way to use SaneBox to keep track of your outgoing messages is SaneNoReplies, a folder that holds a copy of all sent emails that are still pending a response after 24 hours or a different duration of your choosing. When checked daily, weekly, or even bi-weekly, it’s a good way to get a quick snapshot of messages that have fallen through the cracks. 

[SaneReminders](https://www.sanebox.com/learn/sanereminders) |
[SaneNoReplies](https://www.sanebox.com/sanenoreplies)


## Action steps
Quickly scan your sent mail for any recent outgoing messages that haven’t gotten a response. Then, check out

[SaneBox](https://www.sanebox.com/) ,
[Yesware](http://www.yesware.com/?ref=SaneBox) , and
[Boomerang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/l/email-reminders.html) to make sure you’re always on top of your follow-up game from this day forward.

# Day 10 | Snooze emails until you’re ready for them

Yesterday, we taught you how to prevent emails from slipping through the cracks. Now that we solved that tricky email problem, let’s move on to the next one: what to do with an email that you do need to act on, but not right now. If you’re like most people, you probably leave that message in your inbox, possibly even marking it as unread. This causes you to look at it (i.e. spend time and focus on it) over and over. A much better way is to move the email out of your Inbox and have it automatically circle back at the specified date.

If you ever receive an email that isn’t actionable at that time, you still need to make a decision and get it out of your inbox. Remember,

[’e](http://www.sanebox.com/l/inbox-zero-academy-day-2/)

! We’re talking directions to your friend’s wedding next year, a lukewarm sales lead that you need to follow up on next month, or an email chain letter from your crazy cousin that you want to read this weekend, not today. These messages are irrelevant, inactionable, or low priority until the time you want them, at which point you want or need to have them front and center.

_So how do you organize, or “snooze,” these messages?_

First, it is possible to do this manually to a certain degree, though it’s less efficient, less precise, and often ends up in dozens of folders where messages can be easily overlooked. Still, if you want to give this route a try, a good place to start would be with folders for each day of your work week (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday), and another for free time (e.g. “Evenings & Weekends”). Beyond that, you could create folders for “Next Week” and for the coming months. You would move emails into these folders as appropriate, and then visit each folder when that day, week, or given month arrives. Again, this approach takes a good amount of due diligence on your part, as at the start and end of every day, week, and month, you’ll need to make sure each item in the relevant folders has been managed.

_Now, let’s take a look at the easier ways to snooze emails._

As you know by this point in Inbox Zero Academy, we at SaneBox are huge fans of tools that integrate with your existing email account to make it a better place. This fact is no different when it comes to deferring emails. Since Dropbox announced that it would be shutting down Mailbox, there are two main integrations that we recommend:

-   Boomerang for Gmail
-   SaneBox’s Snooze feature

Unlike the manual approach we discussed above, the beauty of these tools is that they are highly customizable, intuitive, and dependable. You’ll never create or work out of a bunch of static folders that are ill-equipped to handle something as dynamic as email. Instead, just tell the program when you want a message back (tomorrow, this weekend, next month, etc.), and it will return the email to your inbox at that time. If you decide that you need an email before it’s scheduled to come back, fear not—the email is never deleted or removed from your server, so you can still access it at any time. While the way each tool works varies to a degree, each ensures that you’ll be working out of a less messy inbox so you can focus on what’s important now.

Because deferring emails is a new concept to most of us, here are a few more examples to get you thinking. If you have ideas of your own, we’d love to hear them.

-   Snooze a meeting agenda until the day of the meeting
-   Snooze a bill pay reminder until a day or two before it’s due
-   Snooze less urgent work emails until the afternoon or next day
-   Snooze that “Take an extra 25% off, today only” email until you’re home from work or on your lunch break

And there you have it—one of the best ways to stay on top of your priorities without missing a thing or overloading your inbox.
