WHO ARE WE?

Simply put, we want to get more people into our great sport of flying, whilst helping them get better and safer at flying. We do this by providing funding assistance to training courses, competitions and site improvements and maintenance.

“The NSWHPA will implement policies and programs defined by the SAFA (formerly HGFA) and to promote the sport through competitions, fly-ins, participation rallies and training facilities to benefit NSW pilots in accordance with the SAFA Operations Manual and with the approval of the relevant State and Federal instrumentalities and land owners.

The NSWHPA also aims to encourage more pilots to take up the sport through marketing, publicity and public exhibitions.”

OUR GOAL

The goal is to update the current design and give both the public, pilots and clubs information they need easily. We will look at minimising pages and removal of content that is out of date and make it simple to search for information users need.

Split public/private content for clubs

> Is this private content for the clubs themselves or members of the clubs?

> Are users of your website signing up to become club members ON your website?

> -do we need memberships for each diff club with access to each one seperately?

> Or if the access is for Club owners - are they managing their own club's content securely?
