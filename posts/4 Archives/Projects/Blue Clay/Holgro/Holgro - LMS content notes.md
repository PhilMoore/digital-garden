# Social Media

### Categories:

I think the Categoreis should be:

Business > Digital Marketing > Social Media >

Then, the following are lsited as sub-categories for social media in the spredsheet:

-   Video Marketing
-   Facebook
-   Podcasting
-   Canva

Should they be created as sub-ctegories of Social Media or just used as tags?
