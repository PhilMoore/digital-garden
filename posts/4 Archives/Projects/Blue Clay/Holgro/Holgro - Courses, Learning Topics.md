# Holgro | Courses, Learning Topics

### Courses

The idea for this section is to include things you have read, listened too and are working on so its an easy source for people to find stuff they have.

the problem is the non-course content has been done via posts. so this is not trackable with learndash.

buddypress - is there way to track what blogs have been read per user, or bookmark posts

# Mentoring:

### Book a mentoring session - Research

We need a system that allows video sessions, where the mentor helps the customer.

A mentor could be a group leader / teacher and can set up / be booked for private sessions

and the mentor can create notes that are available in the holgro site and for the customer and the mentor to see those tasks.

vision for mentoring: tailor sessions to individuals needs / expresses area of interest. create action items to build the goal and track whether they are actioning them.
