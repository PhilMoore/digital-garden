# Categories

Hey guys, I’ve made another small change that I just have to get Laticia’s approval on first, but I’m confident she will give it given the SEO implications.

As such, I will go back and apply it to the posts you’ve already uploaded, but please do so for any new ones (once Laticia replies with the go ahead of course).

When adding categories to your posts, click the “Make primary” option next to the most important subcategory (whenever there is one) so that it (along with whatever pillar  - mind, body or business) shows up in the permalink.

For example: instead of this post just showing “business”

[https://rivmedia-wp-proof.com/**business**/how-to-ace-your-seo-part-3/](https://rivmedia-wp-proof.com/business/how-to-ace-your-seo-part-3/)

It would show _business_ and the first subcategory: _marketing_:
