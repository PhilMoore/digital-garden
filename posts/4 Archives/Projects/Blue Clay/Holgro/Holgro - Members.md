### Members

The site is not autotagging people with certain tiers etc. At the moment everyone is a free member.

### Members - Future Problem

When someone logs in to the site they need to create a profile - we cant differentiate what tier they are in (champion or partner etc)

### Mentors = Champions

Champions role is to refer people to partners (service providers) - they are meant to mentor but not to advise (for insurance reasons).
