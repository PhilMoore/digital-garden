### Email correspondence re. partners page:

> Laticia's comments in RED

> Green: Important to bring up

 Each person has a 'specialities' and 'credentials' section which doesn't have anything in it, as this would require each person to submit this info to us or have it included in their profile in a way we can use in these areas.

 'll past the relevant points from the previous email here:

 Yes, I think we should create a bio form for people to fill out and guide them as to the information we need and outline of bio. Can you please create a letterhead template for HOLGRO in GDoc and Word Doc  and then add [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrPs2iWfo8ElltGZEm5aBwtfr-SM3tdlFe9qRyFJOZg/edit?usp=sharing)﻿[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrPs2iWfo8ElltGZEm5aBwtfr-SM3tdlFe9qRyFJOZg/edit?usp=sharing) to it? Then we can email out to partners to send back so there's consistency. - **::This is probably better done on a seperate page using gravity forms or something like typeform, its much cleaner than sending a document to them to fill in.::**

~~I added a 'View Profile' link under each partner's name.~~

~~Great - see document template - I added for this to provide~~

~~lisa's pic has been updated to a larger version and made B&W~~

~~- ok - please see my notes in doc re specs and logo~~

~~the title section of this page is:~~


~~**MEET THE CHAMPIONS OF HOLGRO**~~


~~**(this needs to be PARTNERS**~~

**- partners and champions are DIFFERENT - we will go over this tomorrow as I still don't think it is clear in the platform but at this stage it isn't anywhere)**  

~~"some kind of intro here about the Partners, what they are, their purpose, what they do for members."~~

~~Our Partners are specialists in their field. They have been hand-picked and vetted by us - chosen due to their special skills and alignment to HOLGRO's values, vision and mission. They are here to support you with integrity and empower you on your growth journey.~~

We know this is not your end goal for how partners and champions will work or appear for users, we will need to look into this & discuss further.

A few options/notes below to look into

ok let's chat tomorrow :)

SOLUTION to partners categorising further - need to look into mor
  

**UNLIMITED MEMBER TYPES**  

Create member categories (like you do for regular member and partner for different specialities/fields of practice (select mind, body or business or any of the above) as i think you mentioned before, so they can show up in the community page

Create public groups for specialities/fields of practice / Pillars and link these in the Partners page

research options to add tags / searchable / filter-able properties to users

users can have multiple types

directory pages for different member types!
