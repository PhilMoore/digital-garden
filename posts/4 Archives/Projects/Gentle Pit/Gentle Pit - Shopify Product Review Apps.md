# Gentle Pit - Shopify Product Review Apps

I have instead gone through the Shopify app store and found a few apps that seem to do exactly what you want and many of them have a lot more features than the standard Product Reviews App Shopify offers.

Here's a list of apps from cheapest to most expensive with some notes:

### [**Automizely Product Review App**](https://apps.shopify.com/automizely-reviews?surface_detail=product+review&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=7&surface_type=search)
 - 100% Free app with a lot of features including review import, product review emails and more. The only issue is it does not have as many features as the following apps.

### [**Judge.me Product Reviews**](https://apps.shopify.com/judgeme?surface_detail=product+review&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=4&surface_type=search)
 - Free to $15mo tops. Could easily start with the free option and move to the $15 if you find you want the additional features. This app has a lot more view options for displaying reviews on the site. Also integrates with Active Campaign (not sure what we get from this but worth testing).

### [**Fera Product Reviews App**](https://apps.shopify.com/fera?surface_detail=product+review&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=9&surface_type=search)
 - Free to $9mo. Full content moderation and control (including editing customer reviews however others might have this feature too but don't boast about it). Ability to display customer photos and videos in its own section.

### [**Loox Product Reviews & Photos**](https://apps.shopify.com/loox?surface_detail=product+review&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=5&surface_type=search)
 - $9.99mo or $34.99mo (if we want all the features). Lots of widget options (not sure if some are locked behind the more expensive option but we do get a 14 day trial to check it all out), can use discounts or incentives to encourage customers to upload photos and videos. Can group similar products and share their reviews.

### [**Yotpo Product Reviews & Photos**](https://apps.shopify.com/yotpo-social-reviews?surface_detail=product+review&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=8&surface_type=search)
 - $24-49mo (based on monthly order volume). Lots of review display options. Incredibly feature full, Q&A section within the reviews. Looks to be one of the prettiest options available.

Please note if you're torn between a few of them there's no reason we can't install a couple of these apps and find out which one works best for us through customising it etc. So feel free to open up all the links and check the pictures to see the types of options they offer. Let me know which ones. you like (or go ahead and install them) and I can play around with customising it for you, importing the existing reviews from our current review app and all that jazz.

  
Overall this probably won't be a big job for me, a couple of hours tops even with multiple apps to play with.
