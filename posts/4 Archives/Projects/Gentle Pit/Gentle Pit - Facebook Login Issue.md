> More info in the comments:

> My friend is logged out of her Facebook and has lost her 2FA key, we've tried going to [https://www.facebook.com/login/identify](https://www.facebook.com/login/identify) as well as contacting facebook business support but neither have helped.  
>   
> Essentially need someone with contacts at Facebook or know how to hack into a logged out account that has 2FA to get it back for her.  
> 
> She is in the same boat as the person who wrote this post: [https://www.techradar.com/features/locked-out-of-your-facebook-account-because-of-two-factor-authentication-learn-from-my-mistakes](https://www.techradar.com/features/locked-out-of-your-facebook-account-because-of-two-factor-authentication-learn-from-my-mistakes)
