## Email to dave about website launch

The website is not live yet and needs a bit more work on the content / specifics & systems for booking / payments.

### Need to sort out before launch:

◦ Logo? - need a logo different to TGB i assume - I added a basic icon to the facebook page for now.

◦ Participant disclaimer

◦ Add game specifics / prices - I'll add the info you sent before - but will probably need more details

◦ Is there an age restriction? (just a thought)

◦ Booking system & contact / enquiry details

◦ System for discounts & promos to link with booking system ideally

◦ Set up payment gateways

◦ Email set up

party@gelblasterpartyhire.com.au

◦ Game promo videos / photos

When did you want to launch? - got a date in mind or just whenever it's ready?

### I have a few promo ideas to get things moving at launch:

1. Party offers: Partys over 10 people get additional people half price for limited time (elimination games only for over 10 people?)

2. Advance bookings: book now up to x time in advance, get x% off entire booking

3. Launch stock discount: book a party and get x off our gel blaster range / x free gels

4. Social media sharing:

1. Share x post to get x% off first booking.

2. Post about your party/experience, tag us and get x% voucher off next booking
