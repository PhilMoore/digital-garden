## Riverstone Competition

[Welcome to Lux4home™. We supply stone sinks, pebble, stone bathtubs.](https://www.lux4home.com/)

The three above could potentially also be suppliers as well. We can contact once the store is created to see if they offer dropshipping or want more distributors.

> **Notes** Not much competition here and a lot of the website arent that great apart from the (two at the top). The only concern I have around the riverstone products in the USA are images. Generally the images we have for S&R are not that great and I feel this might effect sales in this region.

## Concrete Competition

Wayfair & Houzz are a big dropshipping companies in the USA that sells most things, it seems they also do some concrete sinks so you’ll have to make sure you’re pricing is equal to or better than what they offer:

The two below is in the UK but their websites have some good info or pics and seem to target USA related keywords.

> **Notes** Seems like there is a lot more competition for concrete basins vs riverstone or stone basins. Overall the websites for these looked nicer however they offered very limited options around this. Not sure exactly what your suppliers can offer but as long as we can provide good information, a simpler shopping experience and competitive pricing we shouldn't have too much issue breaking into this market.

> **Notes** Fast fulfilment and shipping will be crucial for the USA region, customers are used to 1-2 days delivery from Amazon and many other big brands so we can need to be close to this or at least offer an express shipping option for the impatient customers in order to be competitive.

Theres actually a lot of choice in this sector, I just included a shortlist of a few that seemed good. Ideally need to contact them, get rates once we have some ideas on volume, dimensions of goods etc and start the ball rolling. We also need to make sure they intergrate into the website via shipstation or somesort of app in order to have all orders automatically go to them.

## Costs To Factor In

Most things will be similar to the current AU site with the addition of costs for the shipping and fulfilment centre we choose.

> **Domain - from $8.88 a year**

> **Shopify - $29mo**

You’ll also end up needing to setup a LLC / C Corp in the USA too, there are quite a few companies that can help you with this and essentially do it all for you. This is what I did for my company and thats also the path Brett took.

One thing to consider as well is what state to register your company at. Keep in mind in the USA each state has a separate income and sales tax. Another thing to consider is any state where you have a warehouse or are registered doing business. E.g. business is registered in Wyoming and you have a fulfilment centre in New York, this means you’ll have to pay tax on any sales made to WY and NY but no other state (unless you also have a warehouse etc there). There are apps on shopify that help make this process very easy like TaxJar which starts from $19mo

[TaxJar Sales Tax Automation – Ecommerce Plugins for Online Stores – Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/taxjar)

Here’s some options for having someone setup your company:

[LLC Formation and Incorporation Services | MyCompanyWorks](https://www.mycompanyworks.com/)
[LegalZoom | Start a Business, Protect Your Family: LLC Wills Trademark Incorporate & More Online](https://www.legalzoom.com/country/th)
[Form an LLC or Corporation | MyCorporation](https://www.mycorporation.com/)
[https://www.myusacorporation.com/](https://www.myusacorporation.com/)

Heres’s some useful reading material around choosing a state or entity:

[Where to Form an LLC | Where to Incorporate | MyCompanyWorks](https://www.mycompanyworks.com/whichstate.htm)
[Which Entity to Choose? | MyCompanyWorks](https://www.mycompanyworks.com/entity.htm)

### Optional Extras

I’d consider setting up the following as well.

> **Gsuite or alternative email hosting - From $6mo**

> **Google Voice for your phone system (if you use gsuite) - $10mo per user**

In addition to the above there is also the price of marketing and advertising. For the marketing email and general automation stuff I would use [omnisend](https://www.omnisend.com/) like we are using for S&R.

> **Omnisend - from 16mo**

## Warehouse & Fulfilment Options

[Search Warehouse and Fulfillment Companies | WarehousingandFulfillment.com](https://www.warehousingandfulfillment.com/)
[Print On Demand Books | Print On Demand Fulfillment Services](https://www.acutrack.com/)

You might also need some other systems to automate the process however these can be addressed as they come.

Another thing to consider is a shopify theme. I have a few available that you can use:

[Empire](https://pixelunion.net/products/empire)
[Turbo Theme / Portland](https://outofthesandbox.com/products/turbo-theme-portland)
[close search](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/handy/styles/cool)

The themes above I can install for free as I have the theme files for them but if you want another look or style here’s two great theme developers to have a look at:

[Shopify Themes - Premium Ecommerce Templates - Pixel Union](https://pixelunion.net/collections/shopify-themes)

Let me know if you have any questions.
