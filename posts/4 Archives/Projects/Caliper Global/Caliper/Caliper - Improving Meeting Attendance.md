# Caliper - Improving Meeting Attendance

Based on my research, here are my thoughts and ideas on improving meeting attendance. 

This document is split into two sections:

1.  For improving attendance in group calls or meetings
2.  For improving attendance in one-on-one meetings

 But before we get into this, I wanted to identify the common reasons why people do not attend and came up with the following list:

-   - They do not know about the meeting
-   - They receive late meeting notices
-   - Meetings are irrelevant to them
-   - Meeting time is inconvenient for them or becomes inconvenient.
-   - Meetings have an unclear agenda
-   - They cannot voice out their suggestions

## Improving Attendance In Group Meetings

In order to maximise attendance in group meetings we need to focus on all of the common reasons why people do not attend which are listed above.

- They do not know about the meeting.

Chances are, the people you are focused on getting to attend group meets have received one or more emails inviting them to the meeting. However if you are running group meetings where your are focused on inviting as many potential customers to this meeting I have some ideas on how to increase attendance here. 

1.  As brought up and discussed before, using SMS as a tool would help increase the attendance of people already signed up. On top of the AC integration with SMS I have also found another tool that does this at a much cheaper cost if you are interested in trying it out:

1.  Consider posting about the group meeting on multiple sites to drive additional attendees that might not be aware you have having a group meeting that they can join.   
      
    I was thinking you could maybe have a section on the website promoting the next event (near the top?). That way if they loose the email or forget, they can easily find the next event on the site. This also might attract additional people that are just learning about your business who are interested in jumping in to see what it’s about.  
      
    Another option (if you are not already doing this) is to create an event on Eventbrite or Facebook or LinkedIn Events too so they can be reminded of it and can sign up to it from there. If you want to make sure you are capturing emails and phone numbers through these event invites it might be a good idea to put the Zoom Meeting/google calendar link at the end of a very simple type form that just asks for Name, Email, Number, Business name. This could then feed into AC or other automations and let them know the email is so you can send them the post event information. 
    

-   They receive late meeting notices.
It is common that people sign up to meetings and forget or they just check their emails sporadically and only find out about it a few hours before the event starts. 

What we could do to facility the busy schedule of these customers is offer recordings of the event to people who sign up (if you don’t do this already). We could also easily automate this by having a separate button in the last pre-event reminder email that says “can’t make it? Click here to sign up for the receive a link to the event video after its published”. This would add them into an automation which allows you to follow up further with emails to check if they have seen it or want to book again for the next meeting etc. 

-   Meetings are irrelevant to them.
We could attempt to address this point in two ways, however if they really don’t find this relevant or interesting, chances are they are not a good fit for the course and should not be chased much. 

1.  The first way I would consider approaching this is through the use of language,  it might be a good idea to try and change the language used in our event invite emails to see if that changes the attendance. An example of this is instead of offering to “help” the client improve their branding we could change headings or the email subject to get “peer feedback” from experts in the field.  
      
    My thoughts here is maybe they don’t feel they need help or don’t want to admit to themselves that they need help quite yet, however if we offer them tips and advise from experts in this industry they might me interested to listen and could attend to then find out that this is relevant and they they could do with some help improving their store or brand. 
    

2. The second option could be through focusing the content of the emails to further highlight the agenda of what will be covered in the group call.  We could give a snippet of the agenda and what will be discussed without going into to much detail or offer the first 3 people who reply to this email a live brand analysis on the call as maybe they are on the fence and by providing them the opportunity to gain a live analysis of their store this could sway them to come. 

-   Meeting time is inconvenient for them or becomes inconvenient.
This point is very similar to the above point of “They receive late meeting notices” when thinking about group calls and would be prime candidates to click the button saying they can’t make it. We could also see if its possible to do this via SMS as well and apply tags to send them follow up information after the event or try and get them booked in another future event. 

-   Meetings have an unclear agenda.
This follows up from point 2 of "Meetings are irrelevant to them.” however breaking down what will be covered in the meeting via a bullet pointed agenda would help show professionalism and also give people a good taste of what to expect, hopefully leading to more attendees.

(Not sure if you already do this but thought to mention in case you did not)

- They cannot voice out their suggestions.
This might not be super relevant to your format however it could be a point to consider, if its a group meeting and someone was interested in hearing from experts in the field but was fully engaged by the agenda what you could do is set aside some end points of the meeting for Q&A. 

Another option similar to the above is to open the meeting 10-15min early and let people know via email that if they have any specific questions that want answered you can submit them by replying to the email or attending the meeting early. This would give you some extra points in the end of the agenda that you can cover and also make them feel like they are getting a slightly tailored experience therefore improving attendance.

## Improving Attendance for One-On-One Meetings

-   They do not know about the meeting.
Chances are this won’t apply to one-on-one calls as if they don’t accept the invite you won’t attend either, however SMS messages would help spread awareness to them if they don’t check their emails much.

-   They receive late meeting notices.
Not much to do here but give them the option to easily reschedule in the last or second from last email reminding them of the meeting.

This could be in the form of another text link at the bottom of the reminder email saying “can’t make this meeting? Click here to book another time slot in my calendar”

-   Meetings are irrelevant to them.
This one would be similar to the group point under the same objection. It could be that changing the language form helping them with branding to a private one-on one call providing peer feedback from an expert might change their mind and convince them its worth taking you up on the offer. 

-   Meeting time is inconvenient for them or becomes inconvenient.
This would be another good reason to include a  text link at the bottom of the reminder email saying “can’t make this meeting? Click here to book another time slot in my calendar”. This saves your team waiting around for someone who won’t show up if you can see they’ve booked another slot. 

-   Meetings have an unclear agenda.
I’m not sure how much detail you go into on what is covered in the calls, however by spending a bit of time up front breaking down some of what will be covered in a bullet point agenda format might help people see the value of the meeting and that way they will bother to attend it. 

-   They cannot voice out their suggestions
This could be a good way to get some engagement from the customer before the meeting which could lead to a higher rate of attendance. My thoughts are to include some questions in the emails leading up to the call for them to answer if they want so you can give them a more tailored call experience and also maybe ask them if they have any questions around branding or best practises etc that you can answer in the call. This should hopefully help them feel its less of a sales call more educational and informative and might also help them convert too.
