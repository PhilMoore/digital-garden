## The Brief 2

For the task "Build out a draft of the homepage using the theme sections", don't worry about customising anything in the theme settings such as Colours, Typography etc. Just focus on creating something which has the same content as the [existing homepage](https://www.myurbantrail.com/) but with Our story being a rich text section under the hero image.

If you want some inspiration for an arrangement of sections etc have a look at the [Broadcast theme styles](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/broadcast/styles/bold/preview) on the demo page (there are 3 you can switch between on the top).  
Use existing images from the store, otherwise, feel free to leave the grey placeholder instead.
Don't worry about creating a gallery for the Instagram widget, we'll do this via an app in the future.
Spend an hour or 2 tops on the homepage draft
Let me know if you have any questions etc.


### Harvey Notes
-   SO SNUG Knitted Bobble Hat - NOT INCLUDED on the Wix website
-   Blog Posts title has been changed to Be Inspired to match the original site.
-   Home Page title in Nav Menu has been changed to My Urban Trail as the original Nav doesn't have a home button, just a logo.
-   I have kept the author, date and read time from the original blog in the current one just to preserve data. It can be removed later once designing begins.
-   I have created the collections, but I'm unsure if you would like me to tag each product to match their collection at this moment?
-   Do we have a JPEG or PNG copy of the logo?
-   Include a page for reviews?
-   _Our Story_ rich text has been copied from the original Wix site.


### Thoughts
-   Not married to the hero image/CTA. If you guy's like I can edit the image and move it to the left.
-   The above point applies to all images. If you are happy with these choices I can edit them to fit fullscreen better.
-   Hero Image text has been copied from the original Wix site, but I think it can be worded better e.g. _Be ready for your next adventure with our sleek, comfortable outdoor wear._

## The Brief 1

To start on this project we are instructed to migrate the store to Shopify. The broadcast theme is already installed and just needs all the customisation done.  
  
Initially, I would like for you to migrate the content over and then start on the theme. E.g. create all the products and collections after this migrate the content to the relevant pages.

**Notes**
-   Ensure all variations (sizes) are added to the clothes on Shopify as well as all the images and descriptions.
-   Create product types in Shopify for these products as you are adding them (e.g. Jackets & Jumpers, T-Shirts, Bottoms (for leggings and anything else for legs), Socks, Headwear (glasses, scrunchies, hats),
-   **Reviews** - Ignore the fields on the spreadsheet which aren't applicable, e.g. title, location, reply etc. Keep the state as published, for the product handle, copy and paste the product title for now.


### Questions
-   **Are there any SKU's for products**
Just got the login to the Wix site today so I'll check and let you know - _SKU's have been added to those available_

-   **Would you like me to edit the SEO?**
Dont do the meta stuff at the end of the product page, will probably do the SEO last once the site is good to go.
