## Brief
- Needs emails migrated from Godaddy / Wordpress to something else (unless its Godaddy then it should be ok)
- Needs us to migrate existing site from Wordpress into shopify including products
- I will also need one page that will talk about the different crystals available, with images (but I will have only seven, not as many as on this page)  — [https://violetfrancesca.com/offering/](https://violetfrancesca.com/offering/)
