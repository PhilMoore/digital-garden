Has folder in CANVA where I have uploaded photos of staff and photos from events etc. All other images are stock and sourced from CANVA and I just search what I need. You should as much as possible use the photos taken for TFL [PHOTO FOLDER HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H99J66WN4F5MCFfHZc4ywjjlAkFnDaZn?usp=sharing) . Some of them are old now and have been used in posts but they can also be used as backgrounds. See example [HERE](https://trello.com/c/Uwy5s90d). (in their Trello)
