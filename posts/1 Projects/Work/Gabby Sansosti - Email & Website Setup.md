# [[Gabby Sansosti - Email & Website Setup]]


## Info
- [Things](things:///show?id=868bKS3MvE8P8pqX57Shm2)

## Brief
She is at the very beginning of things and has 2 projects that need set up right now..but **FIRST PRIORITY is getting her emails & domains linked up with her Mailchimp account for KeepItLIGHT.com so she can start sending out newsletters and building her audience while we work on the below.**

#### **1) [WWW.KeepItLight.com](http://WWW.KeepItLight.com)**
• Her Product website where she will sell digital workouts and also physical merch (hoodies etc)
• She has KeepItLight.com via GoDaddy
• Needs [Connect@keepitlight.com](https://mailto:Connect@keepitlight.com) set up and linked to her Gmail 
• She does have a Mailchimp account with one landing page set up so far  that she is using for Social Email Capture. She needs her Chimp account linked to her Domain/Gmail so she can start sending out newsletters 
• She needs a basic website template set up. The catch > she is speaking with a company called [Recess](https://recess.tv/home) , a wellness platform. They are wanting to build her a website on Squarespace and then integrate Shopify. I'm recommending seeing if they can just integrate w Shopify directly and cut out Squarespace. But bottom line, she'll need to need to navigate this. 

  
#### **2) [www.gabbysansosti.com](http://www.gabbysansosti.com):** 
• She has GabbySansosti.com via GoDaddy
• Needs a basic website (no selling capabilities needed). 
• This is her Talent/personality website that she uses to send to agents, casting people, etc. so only needs tabs and navigation for pages with Photos and links to video reels etc. and a connect page She has all of the sections she needs outlined along with the photos. If you get the basic template set up for her, she can drag and drop photos and play around with what she likes from here....
• Needs website linked with her domain and Gmail ([gabby@gabbysansosti.com](https://mailto:gabby@gabbysansosti.com)) set up.
