# [[Harvey - BC Marketing Strategy Brief]]


## Info

## Brief

Blue Clay needs us to make 2 documents on Canva for Marketing Strategies. 1 Is a template, and 1 is a Marketing Strategy for a client, 'Forget Specs'.

They want this on Canva so that anyone can come in and edit it if needed & spin up new documents from the template in the future.

**We are creating both documents at the same time so we can see what pages/sections / re-usable elements we need in the template.**

Focus on building the Forget Specs doc first, and then copy entire pages over to the template, and stripping out the branding (colours & fonts) to replace with the 'generic' branding in the template.

**Hours:**

These are pretty time-consuming to make up & design, hence the need for a template to reduce this every time!

-   I have spent 10h already on this to give you an idea (which included picking apart previous documents to get the structure for the template ðŸ¥²)
-   I think it will be at least another 10h to get the template and Forget Specs closer to done. I think it might be longer. but let me know how you go with it please so I can update the client & their expectations ðŸ˜‰

## **1. Template**

We are creating a template for marketing strategy documents for Blue Clay.

**Canva Document Link (this is a copy of the original so I can swap them out when done)**

[https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHejobvII/jYsLx-qnn_vQSJQcIwihxg/edit?utm_content=DAFHejobvII&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHejobvII/jYsLx-qnn_vQSJQcIwihxg/edit?utm_content=DAFHejobvII&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

-   The template will use generic branding as it will be swapped out for each document created from the template.
-   (just use the blue colours in the doc as backgrounds and use the font Livvic everywhere)

**Current Progress:**

Rach: I have created the template with the overall structure the document needs based on what I've been given, and on the Forget Specs Document content.

-   The marketing strategies made from this will vary in content and order (as you will see in the Forget Specs one) so having a range of options and re-usable parts is key ðŸ™‚
-   We will also need graphs, tables and infographics so feel free to grab some that seem useful from other canva templates and throw them into our one for now.
-   I have added plain title pages to mark different sections of the document - please keep these in there.

**I Created the template from a bunch of other canva templates! feel free to do the same to quickly make new pages or use certain parts. You can use other templates from canva too if you find anything else useful.**

ðŸ’¡ you can copy & paste between documents and even whole pages.

## **2. Forget Specs Marketing Strategy**
We also need to make a marketing strategy doc for a client Forget Specs.

-   I have removed the section title pages as I've gone through & completed each section.
-   This document is being made with the client's branding. So be sure to set the fonts, colours, and add relevant stock images where needed, Also style any tables, graphs etc to suit their branding where possible.
-   Colours, fonts, Logo, overall vibe.
