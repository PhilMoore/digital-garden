## Brief

## **Task Notes:**

In editor mode, we need to adjust the blog post formats to be consistent.

Try to scan through to quickly make the changes, it should get easier as you do a few and know what to look for.

Ideally spend no more than 3 hrs but not sure if i'm just being optimistic with how long it'll take!

-   We are only doing text formatting here. NOT styling. The styling is already handled elsewhere.
-   Most posts are not published to the site and are in draft. But you can still format them, save and publish your changes without publishing the post.
-   Editor mode can be a bit janky - so if it's not responding right just save your changes, re-load from the main edit URL (above) and go back to where you were.

I have already done up to 'From the Director‚Äôs Chair ‚Äì March 2019'

-   So please do 'How to ace your SEO: Part One' onwards üôè

Feel free to check the ones I have done if you're not sure about some of the formatting.

Navigate to the ‚Äòblogs‚Äô tab to edit all the blog posts:

It will auto save your changes as you go so when you've done a bunch you can hit the blue publish button:

You can edit the post formatting either in the editor window below the site, OR you can click the button to edit in the visual mode (so you can properly see how it will look live).

# **Tasks:**

## **‚û°Ô∏è Images & Videos**

Set to full width by clicking the image & setting the style to full: **![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/jSrOJEHRBgMYQt7XZ0eGf_pMldH_2zHJXHR_ThXQvVW_JMjaK2bDowhkJUVzgY82hZoZ3ZPZ8VjMdYyXdsUTNRxpy3LIuJ-gyn0OuitBT4s2hcyKkycLFfxWEaocdupaQVYP9ZE371oPuFCSST0)**

## **‚û°Ô∏è Text formatting**

**Add spacing wherever needed for a good readability and flow.**

**Look out for & add spacing when you see:**

-   Quotes
-   Lists
-   Obvious topic changes / before a new heading.
-   Long blocks of text
-   Anywhere else that seems like it‚Äôs needed

While doing this you will notice sentences without spaces between them, try to spot these and add a full paragraph space here (press enter twice).

## **‚û°Ô∏è Titles**

(I know, they‚Äôre massive - we may adjust this later on)

**Make sure each post has:**

-   NO H1 (this is in the main page title and separate to the main blog content)
-   ONLY 1 H2 near the top
-   If there is a H1 or different H-tag here, change it to a H2
-   (unless there‚Äôs no obvious headings at all - in which case let us know which post it is)
-   Make ALL other headings H3-6 depending on the hierarchy that‚Äôs appropriate or visual cues needed.

To change the heading double click / highlight the text and you should see this to select the H-tag required.

## **‚û°Ô∏è Add paragraph spacing after paragraphs and before new headings:**

**Before:**

**After:**

## **‚û°Ô∏è MOVE text to the CTA (call to action) section IF the post has something appropriate.**

**Note - You can not do this in visual mode**

If there is no clear CTA at the end of the post then no need to do anything.

**E.g:**

**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HBd4GW2VnhlLi0DSLy1TboXX2SXfCRyBgOlZlBpKTpOKAdAYJV20pnXCYdHOX2LgCXyKcu1jhp2TyR97OAOiED0FsjoHRTqb_YUhsw2NLl7ujE4Bn-L3d5gi0cOdUC_5XYKTshc_wKgGdJCK6wQ)**

**Cut and paste it in this section:**

-   **Give it any appropriate H-tag, spacing or bold text where needed to flow well.**

## **‚û°Ô∏è Lists**

**If something should obviously be a list and it isn‚Äôt, please add a list and make sure the text is properly within it.**

**Hit enter to add a new line, then you will see this:**

**Click the + to add a numbered or bullet list depending on what you need**

## **‚û°Ô∏è Please look out for anything weird & send us the blog titles (h1):**

**e.g :**¬†

-   **blank posts**
    
-   **Posts with code in the main content**
    
-   **Anything else that doesn‚Äôt seem right**
