### Olds site stuff to bring over
-   See if we can keep the 10% off pop up on left

### New Site Changes - Desktop

### Mobile
-   Double check weight and size of text - compared to the old theme.
-   CSS for Journal on mobile, can we code it so all images on the journal/blog appear in the same aspect ration for consistency?

### Menu
-   Most popular products are jumpsuits (what they are known for)
-   Popular styles
-   Find a way to make this work better (rewatch the mobile video)

## Brief

Below is a list of updates we know we need...
-   Transfer to Shopify 2.0? We have some bespoke coding, is this possible? We can put you in touch with the web design agency that built it to communicate where this is.
-   Add an FAQ page with drop down questions - nested
-   Add a further nest to main menu
-   Ability to add more detailed colour swatches i.e. checks, stripes, prints
-   Ability to show scrolling testimonials on product pages
-   Adding filters to our collection page, i.e. price, fabric, colour etc
-   Listing product in local currency
-   Using an app which allows people to pay duties & taxes at point of purchase
