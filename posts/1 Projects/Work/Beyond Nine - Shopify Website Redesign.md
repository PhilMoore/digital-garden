### Olds site stuff to bring over
-   See if we can keep the 10% off pop up on left

### New Site Changes - Desktop

### Mobile
-   Double check weight and size of text - compared to the old theme.
-   CSS for Journal on mobile, can we code it so all images on the journal/blog appear in the same aspect ration for consistency?

### Menu
-   Most popular products are jumpsuits (what they are known for)
-   Popular styles
-   Find a way to make this work better (rewatch the mobile video)

## Feedback 2 
[Googlesheet with feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HBt3Mc_VknOzGtylDCL-PqXp2t42Z0dVXpBcTmFRsUc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Homepage
`Desktop` - ~~Remove 'home' tab? People can click on the logo centre to get to home?~~
`Mobile` - Suggested 'product' (under sign up to email) can we edit this ourselves or does this pull through as an algorithm based on what the customer has viewed? (currently watermelon bed shorts)  - REPLIED

### Pop-up
`Desktop` - The pop up in the bottom right, seems conflicting with the 10% offer in bottom left? Our wording needs to be added as it is still the standard text - REPLIED
`Mobile` - This takes up over half the screen on mobile? - REPLIED

## Main Menu Nav
`Desktop` - I don't think the horizontal menu is working - the spacing looks off and messy. Please can we revert to a drop down but with the nested levels as mentioned previously? How do we change the nested headers - Full body needs to be Jumpsuits and Dresses   - REPLIED


Pls make sure all colour swatches are straight and not on angles, i.e. stripes  - REPLIED

  
~~Beyond Nine logo is smaller?~~ 

We've also lost the greyed out bar <sup>I think they mean the announcement bar</sup> from previous website? - REPLIED

~~Main menu should disappear when scroll down?~~   
  
Promotion photo/text box on right to be updated with our wording - where is this updated?   - 

~~The top headerbox detailing about VAT & Duty only shows when on the homepage, it needs to be displayed at all times~~

`Mobile` - When you click on the headers on the menu (which are clearer in terms of layout on mobile) i.e. Full body - they don't work. But I think this will change as per desktop comment.   - REPLIED

Ticker tape don't move.   - REPLIED

Header detailing VAT info needs to be static.   
If you scroll all the way down past the product info the next block needs updating.   

```
Can you provide me a screenshot or something comparing this? I dont really understand what you mean here and cant replicate the issue. 
```
  
~~Please remove the ticker tape sating Free shippping and returns,~~

There is an image missing, the next text section needs completing - currently just shows as subheading, media with text, optional button etc. - REPLIED


### Collection pages & shop all
Can we make sure filters are not automatically dropped down as this makes the page look very messy - all to be minimised. the Header is underlined on the middle letter, we don't have this on our current site.

### Product Page 
`Desktop`  - Description - what will pull through from main description here?  
Make. the main image swipeable? At the moment if you click it only enlarges, but need to be able to swipe through without having to scroll.    
  
Some compostions are incorrect in the new metafields. We need Cupro adding so we can select from the dropdown, please advise how we update this list.   
  
Can we keep the sizing buttons as per our current theme?   
  
Product title to be in capitals as per our current site, text spacing looks wider and thicker?   
Sale ticker tape dosn't really work?   
The review stars are duplicated and show twice, should the one directly below the description be removed as this means the garment price is pushed down and sandwiched between the 2 lots of reviews.

`Mobile` - the additional colour swatches available for a style aren't showing, only the colour swatched liked to that exact product is displayed.

### Footer
Gift. at the very bottom of the product page the currency has defaulted to France GBP £ - needs to be UK. The social buttons are small and less obvious, can they be bigger?

### Pages
Our Ethos - header too small, no arch. Font size/ spacing not as previous site, do underlined. FAQ's = S to be a capital

### FAQS
Can we add this and keep as a hidden page? I think it's hideen currently. Questions with drop downs, make sure opens minimised

### About
Image? Doesn't look as strong as current About page. Do we need an arch? Currently underlined

### Contact Us
Is this linked to our email (RB YES have tested) Country default is france - please update to UK

### Gift Card 
Can the values be displayed as buttons like on our previous site?

### Journal
Do we need an arch? Currently underlined. How do we maintain and update the filter drop down?

### Fonts 
Not all fonts look correct - pls follow brand guidelines for this. I.e. the ticker tape that says 'Drive a tractor in it' - this is not spaced correctly and font it too thick. Please check throughout, should match previous website. Product pages - pls check Vs current product page, for e.g. we have the product title written in CAPS, but on the new version it's all lower case? Arches are missing over headings and it has been replaced with an underline

### Wishlist
Did we agree to add this back in?

### ACCOUNT
We have lost the arch over the word login. It now uses the word Account rather than a person symbol

## Brief

Below is a list of updates we know we need...
-   Transfer to Shopify 2.0? We have some bespoke coding, is this possible? We can put you in touch with the web design agency that built it to communicate where this is.
-   Add an FAQ page with drop down questions - nested
-   Add a further nest to main menu
-   Ability to add more detailed colour swatches i.e. checks, stripes, prints
-   Ability to show scrolling testimonials on product pages
-   Adding filters to our collection page, i.e. price, fabric, colour etc
-   Listing product in local currency
-   Using an app which allows people to pay duties & taxes at point of purchase
