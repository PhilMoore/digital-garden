## Tasks

Can we have a system on a weekly and monthly basis where you send me a Xero report so I can see the exact profitability of the business? - Weekly basis

-   Send Callum a report on the last 30 days, compared to the previous 30 days.
-   Create team@caliper email as a catch all. On google workspace.
-   Look into setting up an Org account for Zoom so billing is all through 1 account.

Look into doing the bookkeeping for Caliper - 1-2 hours max per week - Once we have that working etc, we can discuss further. — Uses receipt bank for receipts - send a spreadsheet or log of what I need receipts for.

## They need a financial system

Use stripe at the moment - accountants don’t know where the end user is. 

-   Kajabi reports going into Xero to update the invoices. 
-   Wants an accurate internal finance system. - Looks at dashboard and see what the numbers are doing.

So name and location on every purchase is required - Essentially creating invoices
40% from USA, 55% UK, 5% on other countries. 
Need to differentiate which payment is for what etc. 
Xero has an open API which can be integrated with. 
-   Amount on each payment and location of the purchase 
Text - receipt bank = goes to Xero automatically
