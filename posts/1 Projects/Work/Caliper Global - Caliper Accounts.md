# Caliper Global - Caliper Accounts

## Info
- [Things](things:///show?id=ANQmC4gNgVpT1VA6Qb759y)


## Tasks
Can we have a system on a weekly and monthly basis where you send me a Xero report so I can see the exact profitability of the business? - Weekly basis

~~-   Send Callum a report on the last 30 days, compared to the previous 30 days.~~
~~-   Create team@caliper email as a catch all. On google workspace.~~
-   Look into setting up an Org account for Zoom so billing is all through 1 account.

#### New Spreadsheet Report Tasks
From [[Caliper Global - Meeting with Callum - 29-08-22]]

- [Read this article](https://parakeeto.com/blog/how-to-calculate-profitability-for-your-marketing-agency-clients-and-projects-the-definitive-guide/) before we do this and ask Callum any questions.
- Total cash collected (via stripe month to date net volume of sales + any banktrasnfers in Wise not from Stripe). 
	- total money spent (costs in Xero)
	- Gross Profit after this. ( (should be 60% ish) (includes both contractor and salaries costs)
		~~- Stripe fees (& bank fees)~~
		- Travel (remove any airline costs)
		-  Advertising and marketing 
	- Net Profit (needs to be minimum 10k per month)
	Do this from Jan 2022 - August 2022
- Create a spreadsheet with this shown like Xero but the COGS are in the correct place and hide it so Callum only sees these 4 data points (cash coming in, Costs, gross profit, net profit)

Create a new tab in this spreadsheet (accurate profit)

## Statement Import Notes

-   Amex needs + & - flipped, by default spent is allocated as received.

---

Look into doing the bookkeeping for Caliper - 1-2 hours max per week - Once we have that working etc, we can discuss further. — Uses receipt bank for receipts - send a spreadsheet or log of what I need receipts for. 


## DoveKing Financials Notes
- Core Team is 
	- Callum £2,500  
	- Ben £2,750  
	- Amy £1,750  
	- Matt £1,600
	- **TOTAL = £8,600**
- All other human costs are Agency (models, photographers, me etc)
- Subscriptions, Ads, Rent etc are 

From now on the gross profit is just the core team and the agency fees (and bank fees). Its basically the cost to fulfil the service

All other costs should be reflected in the net profit. Including accounts and corp tax

## They need a financial system

Use stripe at the moment - accountants don’t know where the end user is. 

-   Kajabi reports going into Xero to update the invoices. 
-   Wants an accurate internal finance system. - Looks at dashboard and see what the numbers are doing. 

---

So name and location on every purchase is required - Essentially creating invoices
40% from USA, 55% UK, 5% on other countries. 
Need to differentiate which payment is for what etc. 
Xero has an open API which can be integrated with. 
-   Amount on each payment and location of the purchase 
Text - receipt bank = goes to Xero automatically
