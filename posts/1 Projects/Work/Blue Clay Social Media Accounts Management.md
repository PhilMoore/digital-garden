## Brief

we can stagger it so we start country change which is a bigger account to wrap your head around for the beginning of October probably that first week ideally.

take over the social media in about two weeks time
Even if I write most of the copy for them to assist in the first place
Think you start with client accounts (minus country change) then when you have a handle take over country change
I might have someone who can take over CC but she is only at 2nd interview stage and I am yet to speak with her

What is the eta with web launch and taking over socials, you reckon? So that I can plan accordingly with Yenny and also my load/announcements etc...
I told Yenny I would get back to her ASAP with the handover time. Said we will take over BC though effectively immediately with the new brand launch this week. I am happy to write the posts if you can just design perhaps? We post every 2 days on BC so if I plan 7 posts for the next 2 week’s of content?

## Tasks

- Check over P17 doc, processes and trello (shared to email)
- Look though current content & accounts to egt feel for content & audience
- Within client folders, read marketing strategys CLOSELY, things NOT to say.

**Email Yenny:**
- check how many posts per week
- Yenny had some reason why they stopped using later (maybe was not later.. to check with yenny)
- access to accounts (youtube, & others that we sont have or are not linked to FB BC business)
- set up google alerts for relevant content etc - can ask yenny where she is sourcing info
- arrange handover if nessecary? (def for CC)
- hours for sourcing blog post images? if we should add to retainers

#### Project Management Tasks
- evaluate if we have everyhting we need to start for each one (waiting)
- figure out which ones we need to start on first & create tasks
	- create later accounts - prioritise ones to start first
	- link all socials to later accounts
	- plan at least this weeks content
#### Content planning
- content topics for week
- images, decription, hastags
