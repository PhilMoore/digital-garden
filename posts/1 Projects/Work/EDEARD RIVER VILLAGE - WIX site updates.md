## Brief
this website was 'half done' then half redone by another web developer and I have no idea what is set up ready in the backend or what needs to be done to get it up to scratch.

Essentially there is no strategic approach to this site and it looks like things have just been dumped as holding pages however I am lead to believe there has been infrastructure set up in the backend.

You can see a project background and info about the website and suggested changes made by previous project manager [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y4aLImq5y93knOuCpGu8v7BMS0C0-megAYQLQvLJ1BQ/edit?usp=sharing). just the first section of background and website is relevant to you. 

  
I don't know what has been actioned and what hasn't.

All I have been told is:

_It was actioned in part_ 

_All the little things and updating to current content_

_The bigger messaging_

_Images_

_Stories etc haven’t commenced yet_

  

**_That is where I need you to: (ASAP please)_**

-   Do an audit of site and map out the current infrastructure
-   Identify what on that list has and hasn't been done
-   Identify gaps in the build (e.g analytics etc etc)
-   Any other recommendations 

  

I haven't even started to look at messaging, copy or a site map yet. So happy to hear your initial high-level thoughts.

  

The only imagery and assets I have been provided are in [this folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-OD-kubHcZoGdGvHnIaOvJsB_PERzLSR?usp=sharing)

  

The brand will be built out by another designer as the only thing created thus far is a logo concept so a full brand suite (typography, style guide, colours etc) will be developed within the next few weeks.

  

**On that, can you please send me the working file for blue clay's branding guide document ASAP please?** 

  

Let me know your capacity and timeline to do this. Perhaps just spend 3 hours initially and see where that gets you?
