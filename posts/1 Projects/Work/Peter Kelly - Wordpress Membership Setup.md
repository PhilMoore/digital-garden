## Brief
My problem is I can't seem to set up the gateway if that is what you call it. I have tried to use Paid Membership Pro on my Wordpress platform but it does not seem to work. I have about 49 pages of content and what I need is for members and prospective members to go to my webpage [https://seasonalworkersnetwork.com](https://seasonalworkersnetwork.com) and either log in or be taken to a page that has what I charge for subscription, 12months or 24 months. Once they fill in all their details it takes them to paypal express or Stipe to pay, once this is done it takes them back to the log in page. When someone logs in I want them to go the main page, [https://seasonalworkersnetwork.com/main-page/](https://seasonalworkersnetwork.com/main-page/), this allows them access to the whole site, I need these pages locked so no one can get into them with out logging in.


## Brief 2
Just a small change in instructions. We are only going to have one subscription amount for now. It will be â‚¬59.95 for 24 months. With an explanation on the page.  

```
We believe 24 months is a reasonable amount of time as we envisage you spending 6 months planning the trip, 12 months for the actual working holiday a d if you decide to stay extra time and you are eligible you still have 6 months membership left to travel around. Happy and safe travels.
