## Tasks
Use Images from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HY340qL9ZJ3-xg-tf9KrYMtm8zuv46yj?usp=sharing)

### Homepage
- Consider switching out the homepage hero to one of the people on location:
  ![[Screenshot 2022-08-08 at 14.09.25.jpg]]
- Under Hero - Rich Text explaining About us, "We are an underwear brand made for and by the LGBT community..."
- Best Sellers - 3 Images
- Under Bestsellers - See other collections and use the full width images on current website.
- Have an Email Opt-In optin between these images or higher up. "Get 10% off as soon as you join our list. You'll also be notified about limited collections that we only offer to our email list"

Ben Suggested to Remove some of these full width images. 
- IDEA - What we could do is use any of the full width ones at the bottom of collections as a form of cross selling.

### Collections Page
- Use a big block image like the homepage as the cover hero to the collection page (without the shop now element) 
- Underneath alternating text/images explaining why the underwear is unique. 
- Collections products

### Product Page
- Fix Description location
- Keep accordion sections
- Maybe setup Metafield for alternative images and move some of the features into more of a page design
- Add Reviews
