# [[SUZIBUKI - Shopify Store]]
`12K Student`

## Info
- [Things](things:///show?id=LLwDzdTNurDxajMTsELNf4)
- Current site - https://www.suzibuki.shop/

## Brief

Needs a landing page `by September 17th` after big London fashion show. 

Needs  to connect shopify with my Godaddy domain names which I opened last year.  
[SUZIBUKI.COM](http://SUZIBUKI.COM)  
[SUZIBUKI.CO.UK](http://SUZIBUKI.CO.UK)

Needs a one page, sales-page style layout where we can get orders in without building a full site with a collections page or about page. So just the one page, and the couple of product pages. Can I put you on a 3-way email chain with the client?
