## Notes

For the lists you need to make pls make a google sheet or doc with blog titles & links, as well as image links/screenshots for reference.

To identify the old graphics, look at the old brand guide, they will be using the old colours, fonts & logos.  - If your struggling to identify old graphics / is taking a long time let Rach know and she can do this stage pretty quickly as she knows what to look for.

When updating the graphics use the NEW brand guide, fonts, colours. No need to redesign too much we just want to recreate what is currently using the old branding so it fits the new look.
