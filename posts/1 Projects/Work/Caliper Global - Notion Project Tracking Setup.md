Caliper Agency - where to create the database for this. 

Pul student info from Students


-   Stages
	-   Roadmap process
	-   Sourcing 
		-   Waiting to start
		-   Meet with Casey
		-   Manufacturer Intro
		-   Order Samples
		-   Approve Samples
	-   Content production
		-   Style guide completed
		-   Products Shipped 
		-   Pre production started (3 weeks)
		-   Post production and delivery (4-5 weeks)
	-   Marketing
		-   Email marketing outlined
		-   Email marketing complete 
		-   Ads setup
	-   Website 
		-   Waiting to start 
		-   Etc 
	-   Launch 
	-   Program complete
	
 There may be little things I need to add to these stages but the important thing is that different stages can be in process at the same time. I don’t have a deadline/time estimate on the marketing or sourcing but website we’ll make 1 month and content is a total of around 7 weeks. 
 
 Let’s put Beyond 9 and My Urban trail in here to start.
