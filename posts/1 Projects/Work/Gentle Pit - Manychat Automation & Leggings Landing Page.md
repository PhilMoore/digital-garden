# Gentle Pit - Manychat Automation & Leggings Landing Page

## Info
-  [Things](things:///show?id=Pb87AXMEymVQZMc3mVhaFj)

## Brief
Saw this on IG and we really love the process  wondering if you know how this is installed? An auto-respond app?  
  
We might want to implement this for our next big pre-sale this month….

Seamless way to get engagement and give people incentives to buy. I DMd her the code to see the process. Auto-respoder w link. So smart

The Link goes right to the landing page to purchase. This would be a Freaking amazing way to get people to pre-order or buy the leggings through our posts that we get to go viral or just for us to have another channel to promote pre-sales in general via our IG channel
