## Brief

we can stagger it so we start country change which is a bigger account to wrap your head around for the beginning of October probably that first week ideally.

take over the social media in about two weeks time
Even if I write most of the copy for them to assist in the first place
Think you start with client accounts (minus country change) then when you have a handle take over country change
I might have someone who can take over CC but she is only at 2nd interview stage and I am yet to speak with her

What is the eta with web launch and taking over socials, you reckon? So that I can plan accordingly with Yenny and also my load/announcements etc...
I told Yenny I would get back to her ASAP with the handover time. Said we will take over BC though effectively immediately with the new brand launch this week. I am happy to write the posts if you can just design perhaps? We post every 2 days on BC so if I plan 7 posts for the next 2 week’s of content?
