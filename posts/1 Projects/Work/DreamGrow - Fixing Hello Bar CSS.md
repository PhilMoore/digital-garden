## Brief

Was hoping to get your help with something I'm trying to build, not urgent by any means:

[https://www.dreamgrow.com/helium-10-review/](https://www.dreamgrow.com/helium-10-review/)

I "designed" this little top CTA bar template to use on some of the affiliate pages like above using GeneratePress Elements

[https://www.dreamgrow.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=33389&action=edit](https://www.dreamgrow.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=33389&action=edit)

I'm struggling to figure out a way to make it "sticky" instead of disappearing on the scroll

I added new custom css via "customize":

```
..sticky-top-bar {
position: fixed;
top: 0;
}
```

and then applied that class to the element container but no luck  
  
Needs to look like this: [https://www.hellobar.com/](https://www.hellobar.com/)
