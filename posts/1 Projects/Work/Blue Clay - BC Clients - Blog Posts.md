## Notes

# **Blog Post Formatting & Instructions**

Please save to **draft** and do not publish - I will check them first and then publish when they're ready to go

  

## Wordpress Instructions

See the screenshot below as an example & showing the areas you **must** fill in & be aware of marked with a star.

  

H1 - Insert the H1 main title as the main title

H2 - Insert H2 inside of the content

  

**Main copy text:**

Paste this into the TEXT tab of the editor & then you can format & re-add in links in the VISUAL tab.

_**Always**_ ensure you are not carrying over any code when copy & pasting by doing this.

**Formatting tips:**

-   always use your judgement for text formatting since what we are given always varies to some degree of 'correctness' ü§£üôÇ
-   If text is weirdly capitalised, paste it into [https://convertcase.net/](https://convertcase.net/) to quickly re-format
    
-   Add a pargraph break between paragraphs / sections with new headings

-   & at the top & bottom of images (depending on the styling of the theme of the website - this might have space already - so please check in preview mode if its needed or not)

OUTBOUND LINKS

make sure they are set to open in a new tab

  

**Categories:**

Will have a main category (usually news or something) and can have multiple sub-categories

  

**Tags:**

Multiple tags, If none are specified in the docs feel free to choose any you think are appropriate

  

### **Images**

**Featured Image:**

This is the main image for the blog post. This will be specified for you - be sure to insert this one in the sidebar area with the star.

This Image MUST BE 1200 x 630 px and Ideally under 700KB

  

**Other Images:**

-   These will be provided and generally, you are free to choose where to place them unless specified. You may also be given more than we need so feel free to decide what is best to use.
-   Most of these should be 1200 x 630px and under 700KB (ideally 4-6KB but use your judgement depending on the quality they come out at when exporting for web) but it doesn't matter too much If some are different.
-   You can also create collages or gallery views for multiple images in one row for example (if you are creating a gallery make sure these images are the same dimensions).

SEO

Slug: enter H1

Meta description: enter meta text / excerpt text here

You will also need to enter these again in the social tab along with the featured image again for each social platform area.

### **üìù July Post**

Please see a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NOfdr7nVInECJ7A9FKtUoNqpozdI7vYf?usp=sharing) to Toomey Family Law's blog and photos.

-   please use the **BLUE image** of 'how to identify your assets' NOT the black one!
    
-   The photo of the team is the main image for the article.

  

TFL Specific Instructions:

-   **Make sure to set the post author to Leisa Toomey** (there will be a dropdown to select the site users in the sidebar or below the post formatting box somewhere) - as this is visible on their website
    
-   pay attention to whether a list is numbered or bulleted or has any intended hierarchy

Harvey Notes:

-   What is the main category? I have just guessed some categories and have added AND PUBLISHED the post. so it's done üôÇ
    
-   The H2 is two paragraphs into the post (which is what they requested on the google doc). Shall I leave it there or move it to the top of the page?
-   leave it where it is
    
-   I'm having difficulty coding this part of the blog 'To locate cryptocurrencies...' Whenever I manually enter the code to create the space whilst keeping the numbered list, it removes it once I save the draft.

-   putting a space after a list breaks the list. Just let the websites styling manage how it is spaced if they want it in a numbered list & donlt worry too much about it üôÇ

-   At the bottom of the doc, it says to use a title that begins with 'financial-disclosure'. What are they referring to with that?

PDL Specific Instructions:

For this you'll need to select a primary category an then select categories again (If there's only one just set it here as well, if there's multiple pick one to be the primary, and then add all of them category to the multi selection area)

  

The H2 field is designed to sit at the top of the post, so if the H2 is witin the main post content, leave the input field for H2 blank and keep it within the main post.

  

### **July Post**

Gdrive Folder:

[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k1fs33bypf1c30PhhNQl2tdlORGttFhS?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k1fs33bypf1c30PhhNQl2tdlORGttFhS?usp=sharing)

Hilighted parts in the document are good to go - just leftover from copywriters discussions but i have been assured its all ready!

  

Harvey Notes

-   In the post it indicates that there are multiple H2's. I've used made the first one H2 and the remaining ones H3's where specified.
-   I've included the meta description in the 'Post Summary'. That is correct?
-   yes
    
-   I can't work out how to copy the table in the google doc over into the blog post correctly? Google is saying I need to input a custom code, but I wanted to ask your opinion first.

  
**A few options:**

1.  insert a table with HTML

-   you will need to insert a code block into the content editor (same as you can add an image, etc)
-   Info on how to code a table with HTML: [https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp)
    

1.  Probably the best option Make the table in SHOPIFY where you can make it visually & copy & paste over the code from HTML.
    

-   make a new product in shopify, make the table, copy the code, delete it

1.  Make the table in another program as an image / multple images and insert them. IF YOU DO THIS make sure to use the right font & colours.

Its better to do it with HTML so that the copy is there in text form.
