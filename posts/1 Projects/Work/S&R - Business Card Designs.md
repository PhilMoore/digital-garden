# [[S&R - Business Card Designs]]


## Info
- Use the [Stone & Rock website](https://stoneandrock.com.au/) for branding inspiration
- Base body font to use `Avenir Next`
- Heading font to use `ITC Caslon No 224` (let me know if you want either of these fonts)
- Colours to use are exported for you as [attachments here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lg7y3AyK2rYjHxl-TLAAN2U-FD8Z9eFq?usp=sharing), the .palette is a [SIP Color](https://sipapp.io/) file if you have this application.
- We have also recently created a big business sign for S&R which you can find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pNcx8GHm0TZ3Z_SGXaQKokge7bJ9_ddj?usp=sharing). This has the assets as well if you find them useful for inspiration or using as bullets like I did.
	<sub> If you want to preview this i would use the STONE & ROCK SIGN.pdf file that is only 3mb. </sub>


**Additional Resources**
- We also have some [business card templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jhzFRCyL3ZskVU7JmZV7sEwrJT8oU008?usp=sharing) downloaded which you can use as a start or for inspiration (these will all need to be changed in size as they are US or EU business card sizes)
- Otherwise you can also look on Canva for some inspiration.

## Brief
Client wanted some business cards as mentioned in [[S&R - Meeting with Eamon 24-08-22]]. 
They wanted a **black or dark front with the logo** and the back with in the main info + 3 lines (not the full 5 the other one has but more spaced out) This can also be to one side and does not need to be full length. 

Here are the 2x examples they gave us:

Front:

Back:

#### **PLEASE NOTE:** The size of the business card needs to confirm to AU standards:
- 90mm x 55mm - 3mm bleed 
- CMYK colour profile “U.S Web Coated (SWOP) v2”
- https://convertacolor.com/ Convert your RGB # HEX colour codes to CMYK and check them in your document. DO NOT rely on the affinity’s colour profiles to convert & make them look correct. This will often end up in off looking colours.

## Tasks
- Design a draft business card using the brief above using Affinity ideally.
