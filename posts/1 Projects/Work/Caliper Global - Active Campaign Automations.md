**The program** When _John_ joins the 3k group coaching program, he gets
-   a 90-minute roadmap call
-   Access to our ‘caliper office hours’ which is a recurring zoom meeting that happens tuesdays and thursdays from 6:30-7:30pm GMT every week.
-   His program will last 3 months


**The Onboarding flow:**
1.  John purchases through [this Kajabi offer page](https://app.kajabi.com/admin/offers/2147897976/edit)
2.  Once he joins, he starts recieving reminder emails for the group coaching calls. He’ll recieve reminder emails
    1.  Every monday and wednesday, 24 hours before the call
    2.  Every tuesday and thursday 1 hour before the call
    3.  In all of these emails, they will also receive this [Typeform](https://mtc6gcu8y1w.typeform.com/to/HQzLyViG) so they can submit their questions to us
3.  John will stop receiving these emails 3 months after he has paid for the program


**Description of the task needed:**
-   We need this reminder email flow setup in Activcampaign so when anyone joins the program they get these reminder emails for only 3 months.
