## Brief
Want a tracking device to use for sleep tracking and general tracking in combination with my Apple Watch. 

Initial research lead me to the [Oura Ring] (https://ouraring.com/) 

However it does not seem to be that great. It's ok but not great. 

Meanwhile many have said a lot of good things about the Whoop Band. This also seems to be a promising option for using during martial arts or even climbing which is nice.
