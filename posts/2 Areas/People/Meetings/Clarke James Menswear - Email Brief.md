# Clarke James Menswear - Email Brief

Hi Phil,  

I imagine you have caught up with Ben by now to discuss our call on Friday? I hope that went well. 

Below is a full debrief of what we discussed – I’ve written this in a way which ensures you can use it as a reference point throughout the work. 

1.     _**Email capture / popups**_ - Firstly, and something which we did not discuss on the call, is regarding email capturing. I need the website to be optimized to capture as many emails as possible. Currently I have an email capture pop-up (which looks terrible as you can see!). Ideally, I would like this to have a visual makeover to ensure it looks professional and aligns with the website’s branding. I imagine this probably includes ensuring the general colour schemes / fonts align with what we use on the site, along with the insertion of creative (which Ben will take care of later so don’t worry about this). I am more than happy for you to have creative license here as you are a professional and it would be a compliment to even call me a novice! 

2.     _**Layout**_ - Secondly, we discussed the layout of the home page. Currently it seems too formulaic and so we discussed the possibility of inserting various breaks etc (for example as they do for the [https://bellabeat.com/time](https://bellabeat.com/time) website) into the page to ensure it flows nicely down to the product on the main page. We also agreed to try and change the source code to make the images a half width of the page. In regard to the layout, I am happy for you to use your creative license but would like 2 things to remain: A) The x4 alternating image and text pieces, B) The page’s flow to remain conducive to storytelling 

3.     _**Colours**_ - Thirdly we discussed the colours of the homepage, and the fact that it looks very bland right now. Ideally, I would like the colour scheme to be similar to the hues and tones from this document as it would ensure the colours align with the branding colours I’ll eventually use.

You said you have a tool which can match colours from photos, so this sounds like it would be useful here. 

4.     _**Conversions**_ – as I explained, the primary purpose of the website is to move visitors through the page towards one of two actions A) To capture their email address for email marketing, B) To induce a pre-order of the product. When building the page, if you can ensure that these two objectives are at the forefront of the design then that would be appreciated. 

A good example I think of a site optimised for conversions is [https://mauvais.co.uk](https://mauvais.co.uk/) as the checkout on a product is clear on the homepage – I imagine Ben will be able to advise on this further too. 

5.     _**FAQs**_ – I showed you an example of an FAQs page which was interactive, and I thought was really engaging. Here is the link to that page [https://lucafaloni.com/pages/faq](https://lucafaloni.com/pages/faq) 

I really like how the have the branded dropdowns on this page, along with the contact numbers and categories of FAQ’s on the left hand side. We agreed that you have a creative license here to craft something similar, but if you could use this example as a benchmark that would be ideal! 

6.     _**Other pages’ content**_ – I highlighted how I was encountering an issue with the content of the other pages e.g. shipping policy, terms of service etc. (the boring stuff) being all the same. You showed me the solution, so if you could correct this that would be great. Furthermore, if you could create unique templates for the pages listed below so there is more of a professional and creative feel to the website that would be brilliant. I feel this would add a bit more jazz and differentiation which is always useful for first impressions.  

Something similar to the pages they have at  [https://lucafaloni.com/pages/care-guide](https://lucafaloni.com/pages/care-guide) would be great - they’re all highly customised and I really think it gives a great first impression. 

7.     _**Product page**_ – We didn’t speak much about the product page as we determined it was highly dependent on the type of theme we used. However, there were some points to mention – can we have the prices set so that when an item is reduced / on offer, the former price has a strikethrough in black and the current price is shown in red? I saw this used on the website below and really liked it.

You will see there are some general comments on the product page in this document ([https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bOW0hwcLYkfgCLZfrQ-x1ktT9gpzpBaTuE_l2uqq2gY/edit#slide=id.gf5b29aeb45_0_31](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bOW0hwcLYkfgCLZfrQ-x1ktT9gpzpBaTuE_l2uqq2gY/edit#slide=id.gf5b29aeb45_0_31)) but I understand that it is largely governed by the theme. The main point here would just to ensure that the imagery can be scrolled through in a nice, easy way – probably more of a UX issue. I have linked some pages below for product pages I like for your reference – they’re very spacious, airy, bright and have great space for product descriptions along with a nice image scrolling mechanism.

8.     _**Mobile optimised**_ – as the majority of the traffic will be on mobile, if you can build the website to be mobile first that would be great. Obviously this doesn’t mean neglecting the desktop version entirely, but I’m sure you get the jist. 

9.     _**Header**_ – We spoke about the header, and if possible to get to fix the logo issue (whereby the logo appears before the colour of the header). Ideally the header would be in white too as it adds a bit of brightness to the feel of the page. Currently it looks quite dark and dingy. 

I think this should cover everything we talked about, but if anything else pops into my head / there are any more resources I can send then I’ll send those over too. 

Please do let me know if this is sufficiently detailed and if there are enough links for you to reference – if not I’ll gather more! 

Enjoy your week, 

Chris.
