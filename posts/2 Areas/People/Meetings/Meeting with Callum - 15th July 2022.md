# Meeting with Callum - 15th July 2022

## Meeting Notes
Attendees: Callum, Phil.


## Accounts
-   Explain how it’s more complicated. Not having to deal with dext or Xero and only the spreadsheet + emailing me or adding to drive should be easier.
-   Physical receipts are really annoying when you add them to dext as it's hard to know what's what without spending lots of time figuring it out. Best to upload all those to drive or better yet email them to me and I can process them, name them and upload them to drive.

## For research tasks.
-   Please elaborate. Generally, unless I have clear briefs on this it’s a bit of a messy job. E.g what do you expect from the research. E.g one or two options and pricing to consider with pros and cons of both?
-   How much time do you want me to spend on research etc?

Offer title - Product 1 (pay in $)

Offer title - Product 1 (pay in £)

1.  (WEEK AFTER) - Call with the team regarding Callum wanting to systemise the business more,

1.  Purpose, where their bottlenecks are with their systems, task management, and time management, documentation etc.

-   Email the team to establish a suitable time to talk about bottlenecks, issues with systems, task management, productivity, time management, documentation etc.

**And above all these tasks are reconciling and gaining access to all services that we pay for so there's less need (after next week) for you both to help me with receipts.**
