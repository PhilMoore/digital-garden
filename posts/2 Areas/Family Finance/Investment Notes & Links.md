## Where to Start?
General strategies are long term hold / hodl until your exit plan. Otherwise borrowing against assets and never selling is becoming more popular these days with Defi (Decentralised Finance).

Other people trade but statistically most traders don't make as much money long term as those who don't trade. Trading also involves more risk, more stress, more fees and more time. Been there, done that, not anymore...

Personally, I just invest with the intention of retiring on my investments. The goal is to trade time for money and then use the money wisely through investments to then free me from needing to actively work and thus retire on my investments. My main strategy is to invest in assets in the crypto space which gives me yield/interest on my crypto (known as staking). This way I'm earning more of said crypto regardless of what the price is doing giving me more profit down the line, especially when you factor in the power of compounding.

What I've started doing in the last few months (which I should have been doing for much longer) is just to DCA (Dollar Cost Average). This means to just regularly (some do weekly, I generally do monthly but there's no right or wrong) set aside money in your paycheque to use for investments and either automate it or just schedule an hour in a day and just move some money around buy your asset and store or stake it.

This leads me to store your crypto (bear in mind everything discussed so far other than DCA is pretty much only relating to crypto). You essentially have 3 options:

1.  Exchange / Defi Platform / Staking Platform
2.  Software Wallet
3.  Hardware Wallet

These are in descending order of security I would say. Hardware wallets are by far the safest option in some ways (but also not so safe in others). Generally, the consensus in the crypto world is "not your keys, not your crypto" meaning if you don't hold the private keys of the location where your crypto is, then you're not fully in control of your crypto. I wouldn't get too hung up on this for now especially as you're just getting started. This is something we can dive deeper into though once you have some Crypto.

## What to invest in?
For crypto investing the first 2 assets, I would look to buy If I did not hold any crypto is Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The main reason for this is because they are some of the easiest coins to get a hold of (as they are some of the oldest) but also because they have a very large market cap.

Market cap is generally what you want to be looking at as well as total supply. Price is an indicator but that's not as important. For example, bitcoin has a max supply of 21,000,000, which means there will only ever be 21 million BTC in circulation, there won't be any more printed or generated once it hits this point (in many decades).

Where as a coin like Dogecoin has no max supply and currently there is a circulating supply of

130,730,434,418 that 130.7 billion. So even though the price of 1 Doge is cheap (currently $0.19 each) it will probably never reach $100 or even $1000 as there's just so much in supply. For it to get to even $1 it will need to be 5x. This leads us on to the market cap, currently, its market cap is 25.7 Billion USD so if it is to reach $1 it will generally need an additional 100 billion USD to get there, for it to hit $100 dollars it will need 10+ Trillion dollars which would overtake BTC and pretty much the entirety of the rest of the crypto industry combined. This is not likely to happen. So just bear in mind things that are cheap arent also going to see the same growth as BTC or ETH did.

Again we can discuss this further but this is a good starting point.

### Security
Look out for any links of any kind discord, emails etc. lots of shit happens this way and many people have been caught out. If you updating something go directly to the website and download the update and ensure the website has a valid ssl. Or for exchanges make sure you go it via your bookmark link not one in an email. Even if you think it’s the real company haha.

Also always use 2-factor for anything to do with investing or crypto which offers it. I personally use Authy for 2-factor as its not on your device and much easier to recover if your phone is stolen etc. Some 2FA authenticators are hard to back up which just leads to not using it or just taking a lot more time than needed. Don't keep your 2FA code stuff in your password manager, if you do it's not 2-factor anymore and if your password manager gets hacked your fucked! That's exactly what happened to me.

This leads on to why mobile apps are sometimes the best option for moving money and managing your crypto. This is because mobile apps are it’s harder to fake/hack than windows or desktop OS. Also when it comes to moving money into crypto it’s worth not using your main bank account / ensuring you use a crypto friendly bank.

I do move money from my main account but I only bank with Monzo, Wize and a Thai bank. So i don't really follow this rule but I also don't keep much fiat around aside from my business bank account which is never used for investments.
