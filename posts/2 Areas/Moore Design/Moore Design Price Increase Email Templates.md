## Loyal MD Clients

Dear XXXX,

First of all, thank you for being one of our most loyal and consistent clients over the years. Your satisfaction means a lot to us, and we hope we’ve been successful in providing you with an excellent service.

We are writing to let you know that we will raise our prices starting from the 1st of September 2022. It has been a number of years since they were last updated and we put this off further to offer some relief to our clients during the COVID crisis. 

Moving forward we are looking to utilise the skills our new team members and adapt our business model where possible.

As you’re already a valued customer, we want to make sure that our price increase is as fair as possible. Therefore we are introducing a retainer model priced at XXX per hour along with the flat rate for non-retainer from XXX per hour, to XXX per hour.

This retainer model will be available for all clients starting at 5 hours per month. This allows us to offer fairer prices for our loyal customers and is advised if you have been making regular use of our services.

If you are interested in taking advantage of this discounted retainer price, we can offer some of the following to your business: 

-   Writing & Publishing Blog Posts
-   Weekly or Monthly Emails (with any offers, updates on the business or new products or services etc)
-   Landing Pages / Funnels / Email Marketing Automation
-   Copywriting
-   Improving Product Descriptions & Optimisation
-   Social Media Posting / Managing
-   SEO Audits & Optimisation
-   Website UX / UI Audits & Optimisation


This plan can be most beneficial during periods of less work required from us, or if you would like us to work more proactively on your business. 

Please note that if you do go over your retainer hours, any additional work will be priced at XXX per hour. Retainers will also be set as monthly rolling contracts allowing you the freedom to cancel if required.

On the other hand, we will continue offering the flat rate pricing model. This is recommended for clients who are not interested in regular use of our above services. The flat rate model will also have a minimum billable time of 30min per task/request/job. If you want to make the most of this model we recommend batching up a few tasks/requests for us to action.

Our new prices will allow us to better serve you and our future customers! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Our team is more than happy to help in any way.

We will happily honour the prices of any previously quoted estimates and will be issuing an invoice at the end of August to bring your account up to date (with our current pricing) before starting with our new pricing plan.

Please do not hesitate in getting in touch with us to discuss your requirements going forwards.

Thanks again for your business, we appreciate it.
