## Pricing Increase Notes

-   Also regarding charging our clients, going forwards we need to focus on either having retainers with clients or charging a minimum of 30min per task, e.g. fixing a page, or doing an update. Installing and configuring an app etc. Of this, our prices need to go up by a lot. $40 AUD for a retainer and good clients, $50 AUD for everyone else (this is our grandfathered rate, all new clients 60 AUD).
-   45 AUD per hour for clients after their retainer hours are over.
-   Happy to do a minimum weekly retainer of 5 hours a month for clients if that's all they want but that's our model going forward.
-   Charge £35 per hour to all clients = 6 hours of work - £210 = £840 per week = 43k per year.
-   Plan to increase again in another 6-12months?
