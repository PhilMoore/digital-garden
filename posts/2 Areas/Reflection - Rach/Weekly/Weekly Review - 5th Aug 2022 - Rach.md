## Reflection Work
---

### What went well?
---
Harvey is doing well with the marketing docs, and we're getting better at colaborating on it now by using comments in canva.

Made progress on the Magazine and handed over 2nd set of Proofs, will be ready to tackle the next stages of this when we have the Ads and need to make the rest of the pages up. Feels great to be on top of this way before they need it so it's not a mad rush like it normally seems to be!

Also managed to fit in time to do the bulk of mobile optimising for BC site


### What didn't go well?
---
Was feeling snowed under with BC site, and still am haha. But now a lot of the mobile optimisation is done its feeling a lot more finished.

The Images for work examples seem to have taken FOREVER to sort out. I think too much split focus on the rest of the project means i'm always trying to rush to get this complete and then jump around to make progress on other tasks so it never gets done.

Phil has still not been able to give me any time during the week for BC website tasks, but has said he will help on the weekend.. so while this is good.. means we are now working on the weekend ü•≤ - will get phil to help FINISH the above.


### What can I do better next week?
---
Comunicate more with Laticia about the website updates - was ahrd to to since I was really focussing on the other work, but regardless of this she still needs to be updated on it.

## Reflection Personal

---

### What went well?
---
We started eating breakfast this week and skipping having a light dinner.

It was hard at first, but getting more used to it and Its nice to eat lighter in the evenings.. not sure how it's affecting anything yet but so far it's working out!

Evening routine has meant we are stretching at night which seems to be improving aches & mobility in shoulders.


### What didn't go well?
---
Working too late, Phil has had a bunch of 'emergencies' from caliper basically every evening this week which meant, even if the intention was there to stop it was literally impossible.

Phil has also been super focussed on looking tinto obsisian which caused a few problems:

Any spare time was spent on this in morning, evening, night, not able to stop thinking about it & problem solving.

**Thursday**

I prepped our class content for us to make it easier on both of us during the class.

phil was too preoccupied with the above, and also not caring at all about the class, and stressed out already about the class thinking the content was about reading & writing.

I tried to get phil up to speed 20mins before the class but he was already stressed out about it and had decided he didn't care.

I was upset because I had spent time preparing to make it easier on both of us, especially him and I wasn't even able to go over anything with him & instead he kind of exploded about how he didn't care and didn't want to read and write (the class was not aboutt his but he had misunderstood because of the document title) And was also kind of talking about obsidian at the same time..

So i was upset because i had spent the time and effort to help us, and felt disrespected and unappreciated by this interaction. I had 0 chance to even explain anyhting, there was no effort by phil to stop the snowball effect or try to get into the headspace to look at the content or to do the class. And we ended up not even doing the class because of all of this..

We spent most of the time of the class talking this out, a lot of which was phil talking about obsidian.

We ended up deciding to not work so much that day, I almost decided to jump in and help him with obsidian. I realised this was a mistake and should not and will not be my focus because HE needs it to be. I had already expressed how I can not be spending time looking into this or switching to this anytime soon.

I had also been feeling that he is not listening to me, himself, or even the advice videos he is watching (from the monks about routine) to try to switch off. When there is a problem to be solved there is no stopping him from diving in and devoting all possible time to it. I feel like there is a lack of self controll no unwillingness to accept the NEED to try when it comes to certain things.

He has a feeling of resentment when i'm trying to tell him to stop, wind down, leave it for another time. he sees it as a nagging mother and I don't think he even absorbs what I am trying to say at the time and jsut hears noise. It hurts me because he is not listening to even himself whe he tells me he's exhausted, burned out, and then says this is different because it's learning... But it's not. because his brain does not stop and he stays up late thinking and researching about it.

He wants me to stop telling him to stop.. BUT HELLO? Im trying to help you. And I am a real human with actual words and LOGIC AND REASON coming out of my mouth with CARE AND COMPASSION TOWARDS YOU. NOT just annoying noise TRYING TO FREAKING CONTROL YOU üò≠.

If he wants to be the master of his own destructive behaviour, Is it on me to intervine or not? It IS within his control. He just doesn't want to accept this. Who is driving? - The elephant, the monkey, or the concious mind.

### What can I do better next week?

Stop being the voice of reason?

Don't stop? ü§£ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Find peace within my own power & accept things I can not change. üôè
