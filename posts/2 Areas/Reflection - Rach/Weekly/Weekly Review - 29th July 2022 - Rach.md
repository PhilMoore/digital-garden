# Weekly Review - 29th July 2022 - Rach

## Reflection Work

### What went well?
Did the bulk of work for CC magazine early in the week - great to clear that from my plate a little more

Handed off work to Harvey to do the Marketing Documents in canva - It was tricky to give that one away and reliquish control! but felt great to get it off my plate & will be a great learning experience for him to get into understanding branding and design.

### What didn't go well?
Have been working on the mbile optimisation for BC website this week too, its been a pain in the ass because pretty much everyhting is unique.

However I made a breakthrough with the navigation and got a fair bit done. But it's all a it of a headache and feels overwhelming at this point & I really wish this was all further along than it is..

We also started using clockify to do time tracking and I keep forgetting to track anything.

Harvey was also doing some blog posts and there was a bit of a mix up about some updates, not a big deal but we both learned from it I think.

### What can I do better next week?
TRACK MY TIME

make sure clockify is set up with proper projects including retainers so i can track properly

Make sure task instructions are super clear - I know how frustrating it is to be given not crystal clear instructions and then get complained at for misunderstanding. It happens, but theres room for improvement.
