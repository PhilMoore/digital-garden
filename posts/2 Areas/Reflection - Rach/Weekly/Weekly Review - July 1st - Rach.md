# Weekly Review - July 1st - Rach

## Reflection

---

### What went well?
---
Finalised pages of BC website before our meeting to review it which was good.

Was able to hand over work to Harvey to do blog posts - through it took work that I didn't feel I had time for to prepare the tasks for him - it's ptobably equal to doing the work myself so either way i'd have had to spend timeon this! - And now he is better prapared to do it in the future and gives him some confidence that we are building up recurring jobs for him.

I did plan and allocate more tasks out over the week which helped meltdown (see below)


### What didn't go well?
---
Didn't do a weekfly review last week - just tapped out after I was finished - I should have stuck it out to do the review or done it the next day, but i then put it off because I didn't want to think about work!
-   this meant I started the week feeling really scattered and not prepared. - not a great feeling!

Still feeling like theres a massive mountain of work for the blueclay website and that i'll need to work on the weekend. especially after our meeting which surfaced more adjustments and re-works of some sections.

Had a bit of a meltdown on.. monday?? because I had so much on, and had to prepare the work for harvey to even aleiviate SOME pressure..which kind of added more pressure to an already stacked up day. I need help to finish the project and phil wants specific tasks allocated so he knows what to do and how much time etc. But when he doesn't have the time for me to even ask.. and they need to get done.. i'm going to do them over plan and allocate them to him..

Also had a 'last minute panic' job to do on thursday along with school and meeting with laticia leaving basically no time to do the tasks allocated.

I also over allocated tasks up to 6/7pm most days because there's so much to do. And phil said this makes him feel he must do the same. so somethignt o be aware of there..


### What can I do better next week?
---
Don't just ASK and TELL but demand time from phil to help with this project. Otherwise my request is not clear enough and is forgotten / overwritten by other client work.

Plan days and allocate set tasks to phil. we need to sit down and discuss this at week start. (or sunday so we are ready for the mammoth week ahead ðŸ˜…)
