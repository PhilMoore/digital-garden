# Weekly Review - June 10th 2022 - Rach

## Reflection

---

### What went well?
---
Made good progress finalising pages and colours for BC site

Was able to tick off some other tasks for laticia which gave me a break from only bc website work

CC is happy with the magazine layouts and mockups were completed under the quoted time

Started on webflow build


### What didn't go well?
---
Progress with using and understanding Amplenote - partly because the calendar and task views are not quite working as needed, and also because of working on such a large project - it's difficult to break everyitng down into scheduleable items, rather than just jumping in and working ad-hock

-   though I have been breaking the tasks down and ticking off as I progress - they're not schuduled so i'm still just working off 1 ambiguous time block.


### What can I do better next week?
---
Break tasks down from big projects - maybe adding time durations and adding them into calendar could help.

And maybe making a task or set of tasks for the day with goals on how long to spend..
