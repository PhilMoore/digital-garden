## Reflection Work

---

### What went well?
---
Phil helped me almost every day this week for 1h. which was great. really helped me smash through things and get much needed feedback on things it was easy to overlook after staring at this beast for fucking 4 months.

He also helped me at the weekend to make the remaining 'our work' images.

I can actually see the light at the end of this tunnel.ü§£

I also made sure i was on top of everything else I was doing, asking questions about the next stages about teh magazine and making sure i'm ready to get it done as soon as it comes back to me again.

I also started using _**Things**_ as the to-do list & scheduling tasks. Which is SO MUCH easier to use for time blocking and actually seeing and organising tasks.


### What didn't go well?
---
On wednesday


**In the morning**
I replied to laticia apologising (again) for how long things are taking due to us being overworked and having no help & constant set backs


**At the end of the day**
she replied to an email about logos that she needed for an event:

"Yep. Still not what I‚Äôm after.

Can we please chat?

I‚Äôm just a bit concerned about all of this and the website tbh."

-   after saying nothing in response to the message that morning
-   right at the end of the day
-   not saying anything specific about what she actually want or needs with these logos

so i'm already feeling awful about the state of this project and how long its gone on for not to mention all the time im putting in to get it done unpaid

after seeing this email i'm still trying to continue working and look at it again when i'm actually done. Obviously this is impossible!

**I get phil to help me reply:**
"Please be specific, what do you need or what colours are you wanting for the logo? - or what you are not happy with.

Sorry we keep pushing the website week by week, but as I tried to explain in the previous email around the website we are very time poor right now, and unfortunately It‚Äôs only the 2 of us, and many clients have been throwing ‚Äòurgent‚Äô work at us, and this causes us to have to move goal posts a lot.

Do you have a concrete date you need the site done by, as when we did have our meeting a few weeks back you said you were in no rush.. if so please pencil something in and we can let you know if its realistic, Ideally we need another week to finish of the animations."

to which she replied:
-   she doesn't want to have this convo via email (adding fuel to the anxiety fire, thanks)
    
-   she's been really patient, several emails have gone unanswered and she feels ignored - the was maybe a few left for a couple of days..i.e.. monday and tuesday.. after weeks of VERY thorough listed updates and convos back and forth
    
-   she's been 'trying to talk to us about this for ages' -- what is "_**this"**_, and.. have you??
    
-   I have barely seen any progress on things and my concerns about colour combinations haven't been addressed despite me stressing this. The logos and parts of the website do concern me but I have been waiting for you to say I can review the site - yet nothing seems to be really moving. I emailed her about the specific pages she was concerned about r.e colours... NO REPLY FROM HER, literally have ben actioning 90% of what she asks for asap. There's no reason why she can't review and tell us if she isnt happy with something! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

so we fought our corner and apologied for our shorcomings

a few more emails back and forth

THEN she apologises for replying to me about logos when she was tired.. thanks.. it's already escalated too far and NOW I"M A WRECK

So i'm a total mess (already was since the first email) and literally questioning if I am the crazy one here and if this is all my fault.

Phil helped me disect what went wrong with this project.

-   We each had our own faults that have contributed to how this turned out, not to mention our current workload situation which is really only a part of this equation.
-   It was all a mess and not what we expected from the start and we never put our foot down before it got way out of hand.

**Thurdsay**
I was a mess the next morning too and it weighed really heavily on me. I took some time to calm myself in the morning but it wasn't super effective. I attended class with the camera off.

I wrote myself a list of the most important thigns to complete / fix on the website by the end of the week and DID THEM ALL. Was able to work ok for the rest of the day and responded to Laticia about both the logo and a full rundown on the website progress.

**Friday**
I'm feeling pretty good after getting a the major issues with the website fixed on thursday, and I FUCKING SMASHED IT with all of the other tasks I had to finish off for it.

Still a few pre launch prep work to do but i feel great about what I acomplished this week regardless of the shit show with Laticia. I did everything I possibly could. Other than explain the situatuon and continue doing the work theres literally nothign else i can do and she needs to understand this. IT IS WHAT THE FUCK IT IS.


### What can I do better next week?
---
Try and be more zen when others are clearly not.

It is the reaction that defines the situation.

It's difficult not to take thigns to heart, or question myself when in this situation. But it's equally important to stand up for myself and fight my corner. It's a tricky balance... I guess it's my nature to figure out what the issue is and i definately think it's important to ask myself IS IT ME? - which maybe others aren't willing to do ü§£

## Reflection Personal

---

### What went well?
---
The routines are feeling more natural, less forced. Still feels confusing to me at night time that we don't go upstairs to watch something. I guess this is a HUGE habit we have built up over our.. entire time together, and even lives when apart.


### What didn't go well?
---
We're both struggling with the balance of work, improvements, and its difficult not to point blame at at time that hs been a serious struggle for both of us. So I think that's an important lesson of the week. We're both trying our best and trying to come out the other end of this as better humans, and a stronger partnership.


### What can I do better next week?
---
1.  No more blame on each other.
2.  More FUN together.
3.  Make sure I wash and maintain my dreads!
4.  ATTEND AND PARTICIPATE IN CLASS
-   I would love to not wake up feeling stressed about blueclay project.
-   I would love to not have a weekly meltdown ESPECIALLY on a Thursday morning üòÖüò≠
