# Weekly Review - June 17th - Rach

## Reflection
---

### What went well?
---
Progressed well with BC website & feeling confident about the completion time now that building pages is becoming quicker (re-usable sections etc)

This week I broke down tasks into more actionable items with allocated times - I got better at this throughout the week & was pretty good overall at estimating how long tings would take.

We have both been better at not working too late though its easy to keep going, especially if you scheduled too much for one day.


### What didn't go well?
---
Really difficult to focus after school on thursday. & felt not much capacity or motivation to work after that point.

Bad at taking breaks - maybe should schedule times for this - I know phil doesn;t do this either and its tricky to find a 'good time' to step away form the computer because the work never feels done.


### What can I do better next week?
---
Adding time for breaks

Not over-scheduling tasks and thinking i'll just push it to the next day! - Only schedule what is realistic. Otherwise a break will definately NEVER happen.
