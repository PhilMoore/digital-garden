# Weekly Review July 8th - Rachel

## Reflection Work

---

### What went well?
---
making a ton of progress with the blue clay site and laticia loves it


### What didn't go well?
---
a few meltdowns, panicking about how long things are taking and not getting help

feeling extra pressure from phil who has transitioned to another organisation ssytem and now I am feeling behind and expected to catch up with the new systems when im struggling to get all my workload managed as it is.


### What can I do better next week?
---
I need to MAKE space & time to be objective & plan.. & assess progress

If i can spend the weekend catching up with PARA and spend some time assessing the BC project as well that will help me feel prepared for the week ahead. - Also planning out tasks for phil would be great to do.

## Reflection Personal

---

### What went well?
---
we did yoga twice this week, which was great


### What didn't go well?
---
when im in panic mode already, and i get negative input / feedback i shut down and stop talking


### What can I do better next week?
---
when im overwhelmed and feel my confidence draining, try not to shut off, speak and don't let phil keep talking in circles.

he needs me to verbally communicate that i understand.
