## Reflection Work

---

### What went well?
---
At the weekend we reviewed our goals and started a morning routine this week

We have dedicated time to plan our day and disucss it before we start working, as we would just jump straight in and instantly feel scattered or out of the loop with each other.


### What didn't go well?
---
Wendesday phil had a meeting scheduled early, since his meeting calendar wasn't updated to our new routine!

I also had scheduled to wash my hair on weds morning.

I didn't plan my day and just go straight into working, the whole day felt chaotic and scattered for both of us.

After the meeting with Laticia last week I thougt it was ok to take a breather form the website and focus on the client wprk she needed. But turns out she also expected progress on the website as we gave the impression the website wouldnt take too much to get to a more finished state (which is not wrong) But then i feltt too much expectations to progress with ALL projects for her which made it difficult to know what to prioritise.

BUT after this i just decided what to focus on for the next few days and managed to progress with a lot of work so i'm actually feeling good about how the week ended!

Also not being able / wanting to stop work at a certin time

And knowing when its time to switch tasks


### What can I do better next week?
---
DO NOT miss planning the day in the morning! Wow what a difference it makes!

I'm also trying to block bigger blocks of time for the long projects I have which is helping to decide where to put my focus through the day, and not constantly pushing tasks because they actually span days or weeks with no definable tasks (or theres no point micromanaging that much)

e.g spend 3h on CC magazine
spend 4h on marketing strats
spend 3h on website tasks

Set alarm for time blocks so i'm aware of the time & when i need to be doing something else!

## Reflection Personal

---

### What went well?
---
We started the new routine, which meant that we had time and dedication to DO YOGA & exercise every day other than wednesday which was madness..


### What didn't go well?
---
Possibly smoking on monday - we felt tired, unmotivated, scattered after this. which was a suprise since we started on monday with so much motivation and were feeling great.


### What can I do better next week?
---
Work on the afternoon check ins & trying to stop at a reasonable time.. and not just carrying on to try and get more done!!
