## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Sleepy but better than yesterday. Went to bed at 9:30 pm which I'm sure helping.
-   Not feeling energetic enough for Yoga or movement this morning.


## ðŸ’¡ Interest or activity of the day?
> Can also include a message or links of the day
-   The focus of the day is getting the work done and catching up on stuff I should have done yesterday. This includes packing up all the drinks we have been given, vacuuming and chilling.
-   Finally going for that massage
