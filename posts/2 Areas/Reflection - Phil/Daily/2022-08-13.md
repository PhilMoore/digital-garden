## Daily Review

### ðŸ“• Day Log & Review
- Great weather this morning. Woke up feeling good about the weekend, ate my oats and worked on de-duping google drive and went to Kali. 
- Kali was a lot of fun with Luis and enjoyed learning more of his schools style which works out to be more like Wing Chung. 
- Went to wooden door with [[Mina Schubert]] and [[Sakan]]  was good chatting about TV shows. 
- Went home after and started on all the other tasks for the weekend and completed de-duping. 
- Later went to see [[Brett Rawlings]] at Dank Heaven. Met a cool Thai guy who owns a bunch of properties and buildings not being used. Looks like we have the perfect opportunity for investment and growing Weed 1min away from Dank Heaven. 
- Came home chilled with Rach and worked on [[Obsidian Migration]] project. 


### ðŸ—“ Tomorrow, I need to...
Finish up on all the financial tasks
Complete Sunday chores
Make more progress on migrating to Obsidian.
