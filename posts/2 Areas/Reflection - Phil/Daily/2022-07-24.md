## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Sleepy and hungover, got 4 hours sleep after the party going to bed at 3am. Woke up at 7:30 ish to make coffee and start cleanup.
-   Threw up after cleanup and ate Daal to keep me feeling comforted.
-   Noticed my right arm is swollen in a few places. Think the wasp stings are showing up.
