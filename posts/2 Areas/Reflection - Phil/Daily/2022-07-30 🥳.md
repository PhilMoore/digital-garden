## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Woke up feeling sleeping and a little under the weather (funny taste in the back of my throat and low energy).


## ðŸ’¡ Interest or activity of the day?
-   **ITS MY BIRTHDAY! ðŸŽ‰**
-   Went through all of our Goals with Rachel, made some plans, went shopping to TOPS & Baan&Beyond for a shower head and got a few little things from there
-   Also bought a Kindle Paperwhite, time to start reading with my evening routine.
