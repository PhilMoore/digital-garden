- [x] [Use timely reminders](things:///show?id=TF8y5FeJd7n7HBCVhNiU9v)

	Tap the calendar button below, then tap Add Reminder, and set a time.
- [x] [Tag your to-dos](things:///show?id=MrURjyEUCDuXVq9gAoG2d3)

	Things supports Markdown for adding structure and style to your notes.
	If you don‚Äôt know Markdown, here‚Äôs how it works. To emphasize a word, simply surround it with asterisks, like so: *emphasized*. As you can see, Things detects this and displays the word in italics. If you remove those asterisks, it will go back to normal.
	Here are a few more examples:
	- Use two asterisks to make text **bold**
	- Use colons to ==highlight text==
	- Insert ‚Äú#‚Äù at the beginning of a line to make a heading, like so:
	# This is a heading

	Markdown is a bit quirky, but it‚Äôs great for quickly styling your text while you type. You can also use keyboard shortcuts, which you can find in Edit ‚Üí Markdown.
