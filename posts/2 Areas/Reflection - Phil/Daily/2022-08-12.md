## Daily Review

### üìï Day Log & Review 
- Last night l slept pretty well, went to bed without meditating or reading a book 
- Woke up feeling reasonably alert and testing handwriting this with a pencil. I'm curious if this will help make my hand writing better or at least help with note taking compared to using a keyboard.
- Goodnotes seems better than Notabiliy, thinking of switching after my test
- Completed my first [[Weekly Review - W32 August]] on Obsidian


### üóì Tomorrow, I need to...
- Do a bunch of finance tasks with Rachel we put off last week.
