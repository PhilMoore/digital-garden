## üìï How are you feeling today?
-   Had a bit of an unfortunate situation with Rach this morning. She worked on Thai stuff I worked on [Obsidian](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/a4aada7e-126f-11ed-b96e-7eb08a2c5cd0) and I got annoyed at having to learn reading and writing Thai already. It‚Äôs too much for me to focus on right now.
-   Ended up not going to Thai class. Talking it out and finished work at 5pm. It‚Äôs been a great day other then that.


## üí° Log
   Figured out we can just share a things 3 account which makes life easier. We‚Äôll see how it works in practise.
-   Obsidian Sync works great so the syncing element of Rach and I using obsidian is looking likely. Now to experiment with it a bit more and setup my templates.
