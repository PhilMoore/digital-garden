## Daily Review

### üìï Day Log & Review
- Went to bed around 11 last night, watched more sandman and read RP2. Finding that I can sleep pretty easily and without much issue. 
- Woke up feeling good and rested, Sun was shining and I spent the morning work on on [[Obsidian Migration]] I tried the quartz method but it was not working out well. Ended up finding another option so gonna try that after work. 
- Work was scattered in the sense that I started off the day feeling like there was not much work. Then decided to plot out a day which was more then a full day. I'm just so used to seeing like 40 tasks in one day üòÖ
- I also had a meeting with a Eamon today which went well. 
- It started well but after I started going through emails I fell into the trap of just answering them instead of noting down the tasks and responding quickly or later. 
- I feel this method was in someway needed as I hadn't done a triage on the emails for a day and I'm also focused on clearing older projects hanging around. 
- 5:30pm finish. Overall the day was productive. 
- After work we went to see [[Harvey Monro]] and welcome him back to Chiang Mai at Dank Heaven. Smoked a J and then noticed the wires outside where on fire. Also the transformer by Core Combat exploded the day prior. 
- We chose to leave after the fire was put out and go to May Kaidees where we stumbled into [[Paul Bashir]]  , we all had dinner together which was delicious. 
- Harvey left and Paul, Rachel and I went to Dank Heaven again where we spent the rest of the evening talking and smoking with [[Brett Rawlings]] 
- Today was also the day I learned that it was not possible to fix my watch. So instead I am going to wait until the new Apple Watch comes out and buy that. It has lasted me 4 years and I'll buy a cheap dumb watch until then. 


### üóì Tomorrow, I need to...

- Buy a cheap dumb watch 
- Try and complete other tasks I didn't do today and push off anything that's not that urgent.
