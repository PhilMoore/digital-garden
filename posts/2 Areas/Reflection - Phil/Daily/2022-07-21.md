## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-  Sleepy and slow start. Feeling annoyed still about Callum's voice message stuff. I don't know why this is though just making me hold stress and tension in my body and mind. I really should have meditated last night to see if I could clear it.
-   Finding voice messages in the morning fuck up my productivity - Best to listen to them after lunch when I'm in a better focus state?


## ðŸ’¡ Interest or activity of the day?
> Can also include a message or links of the day
- [[Henry Fahl]] coming over tonight to discuss potential work options for him at MD as well hanging out
