## Daily Review

### 📕 Day Log & Review
- Woke up with very poor sleep. I feel it could have been down to being stressed about the Dentist or the 2 beers  + J I had the night before 🤷🏻‍♂️
- Had a very slow start, the morning was dark and grey too which did not help and did our chores.
- Ended up not having to get a root canal at the Dentist as they did not book the specialist for it. This instantly made my day.
- Next up I got back home, did some work on my weekly review and took Rachel to martial arts. 
- Went to meet [[Paul Bashir]] at Dank Heaven and smoked a pure J of Kirkwood OG which knocked me out. Got home and tried to rest for 20min before [[Stephanie MacNeill]] came over to go check out an apartment nearby. 
- Afterwards we chilled for a bit, ordered Anchan - 1 portion would have been fine but i also ate Rachels which made me far too full and lead to me being bloated and feeling too full all night.
- We watched House of the Dragon and then went to bed around 9:30pm shortly after. 


### 🗓 Tomorrow, I need to...
- Wake up and help [[Casey Boshae Williams]]
