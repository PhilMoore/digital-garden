## Daily Review

### ðŸ“• Day Log & Review
- Rainy morning woke me up. Around 7am so not too bad. Feeling quite sleepy in the mornings but also somewhat alert, just had a long work day yesterday so im sure its taking its toll.
- Got a lot to get on with today but i feel after this week I'll have a lot less on my plate which sounds great right about now!
- Crazy day of work seems to be scheduled tomorrow. Definitely falling behind on tasks and getting a little distracted at work. 
- I don't think YouTube or videos should be allowed and any work which can be done while watching them needs to be delegated. 



### ðŸ—“ Tomorrow, I need to...
- Do the Alida products 
- Help Rachel 
- Build Casey leggings listings (with image)
