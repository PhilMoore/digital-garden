## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Feeling good woke up early, before my alarm (6:30am) and did my morning reading
-   Starting [[Rach - Morning & Evening Routine]] and just finished the exercise segment, so far that day is going good.
-   Thinking to have a shorter day, aim to finish at 4pm as we've had a big weekend and a lot of stuff to do this week.
