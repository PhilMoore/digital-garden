## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?

-   Did not sleep until midnight, was very obsessed with [Obsidian](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/a4aada7e-126f-11ed-b96e-7eb08a2c5cd0) last night thinking of possible ways to use it to replace Anote, it seems not great for tasks etc but after learning that it intergrates well with [Things 3](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/36d18aac-12dd-11ed-a1b4-7eb08a2c5cd0) & [Todoist](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/46c611bc-12dd-11ed-8f5c-b244f95defbd) as well as giving us the ability to Timeblock easily on fantastical via drag and drop on things 3 + the Raycast extensions for both Things and Obisidian I feel this is gonna 100% replace ample note once i get to grips with it. Just gotta figure out team sync on folders and shit like that...
    
-   Woke up at 6:30am and continued researching and testing [Things 3](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/36d18aac-12dd-11ed-a1b4-7eb08a2c5cd0) & [Obsidian](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/a4aada7e-126f-11ed-b96e-7eb08a2c5cd0) seems promising but it will take some work to figure it out... Did not do yoga or much of the morning routine because of this.
    
-   Feeling pretty tired but the day should be easy work-wise it seems.
