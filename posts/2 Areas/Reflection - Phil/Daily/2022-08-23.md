## Daily Review

### ðŸ“• Day Log & Review
- Another good sleep last night, felt a bit full this morning from eating a bit too much. I need to stop eating dinner or start eating lighter snacks instead of a meal for dinner.
- Day is looking good, not too many tasks and I started the day out working on some [[Obsidian Migration]] tasks then did Yoga.
- Ended up working until 5:29 then went to Kali. Training was good today and we learned some [Decampo Kali style ](https://www.facebook.com/10002542/posts/pfbid0rvP4DG74JV792fhZHFQs3jSXpQAovy6DMhCEisNwTUGApN6DTTRuZBTrv5xUGvpjl/?d=n)) drills and worked on sparring. 
- Work was good and ahead of schedule until I got the the Alida work. Then spent a few hours focusing on finishing that. It's close and it's been a big project but has taken a lot of focus and time. 


### ðŸ—“ Tomorrow, I need to...

- Log what I've done to setup Automator sync on obsidian to quartz - *found a better method now* 
- Finish setting up obsidian syncobsidian to quartz
- Read the new D&D Rules [here](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/character-origins/CSWCVV0M4B6vX6E1/UA2022-CharacterOrigins.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest1)
