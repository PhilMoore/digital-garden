## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?

-   Slept well after completing our evening routine for the first time, stretched, chilled, meditated for 20min and read a little.
-   Also, first morning where I'm eating oats/breakfast etc. So far so good although its a weird experience having food in my stomach in the morning...

-   Ended up doing neither and researched [Obsidian](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/a4aada7e-126f-11ed-b96e-7eb08a2c5cd0) a bunch. Itâ€™s not possible for me to use it like Amplenote for calendar time blocking and tasks yet. Tasks look very messy at the moment.
    
-   Final [Obsidian](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/a4aada7e-126f-11ed-b96e-7eb08a2c5cd0) conclusion, if I can download the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nicolevdh) Vault and it works well for D&D I can use it for that ans experiment with its
