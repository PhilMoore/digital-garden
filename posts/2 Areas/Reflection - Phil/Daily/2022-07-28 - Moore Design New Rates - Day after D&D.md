# July 28th, 2022 - Moore Design New Rates - Day after D&D

## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Super sleepy, went to bed around 12 after D&D as we didn't finish until 10:30. By the time people left and Rach and I chilled for it a bit it got late.
-   Overall I feel like I didn't really enjoy D&D last night, the first few hours where fun but I'm not really "feeling" this character or campaign tbh, I have no real backstory and don't really care. Also I don't think playing D&D on a week night is good. Please don't do this again Phil, push for a weekend session or don't go.

-   Had a big thought about my work-life balance. My problem is I say yes to helping people and it's generally for too little money. I need to be ok with charging and I need to focus on going after clients worth my effort not cheap bad clients.
-   Also regarding charging our clients, going forwards we need to focus on either having retainers with clients or charging a minimum of 30min per task, e.g. fixing a page, or doing an update. Installing and configuring an app etc. Of this, our prices need to go up by a lot. $40 AUD for a retainer and good clients, $50 AUD for everyone else (this is our grandfathered rate, all new clients 60 AUD). Happy to do a minimum weekly retainer of 5 hours a month for clients if that's all they want but that's our model going forward.
-   Availability for big jobs from clients or new client work is the 22nd of August. (Excluding Caliper)
-   Did some work on [[Moore Design Goals]] - New rate is Â£35ph for all new clients - starting September 1st
