## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Pretty good, slept well, consistently completed 3 10x meditations before bed over the last few days which i'm finding is helping me get to sleep better.
-   Woke up before my alarm feeling fresher than I did the night before even though I went to Kali yesterday.


## ðŸ’¡ Interest or activity of the day?
