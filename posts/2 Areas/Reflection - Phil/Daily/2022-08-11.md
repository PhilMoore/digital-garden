## Daily Review

### ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
- Dident sleep too we'll just came upstairs, brushed teeth and crashed last night then woke up an hour later awake thinking about work or obsidian or something. 
- Got back to bed after but feeling tired today. 


### ðŸ’¡ Day Log
- Did Thai class today and added some notes to Travel section of [[Learning Thai Lvl 1]]
- Really enjoyed my experience using obsidian today during Thai class, having the same note opened twice. 
- Things 3 is also going well I feel I can review the days tasks much better than I previously could in Amplenote. 
- Completed 90% of todays tasks although I was a bit slow at the end of the day. Ended up working late and finished around 6:50. 
- Got one of the UltraCC people to help with my Seedbox today. Looks like it is fixed now. Need to still dedupe though.
