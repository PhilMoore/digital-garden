## Daily Review

### ðŸ“• Day Log & Review
- D&D went well yesterday, i actually had a fair ammount of energy even until the end. I did however notice my concertation/focus go after vaping, thats basically around the time my D&D note taking ended... Interesting thing to note and something to pay attention too if i want to take good notes.
- Went to bed around 11pm in the end, just chilled, debrieffed with Rach, vaped and went to bed. Slept ok but woke up in the middle of the night awake and then again at 7am before my alarm. 
- Today is the day i had to also wake up and get started with work as [[Gentle Pit - Pre-Launch]] emails are happening and I had to be on standby with Casey.
- I also ended up having a go at [[Rachel Moore]] this morning for not doing my EOD tasks that I wanted. This upset her but I felt it was warranted, its hard enough managing everything without her also making things harder for me. Especially as I set this up to help her too. 
- Planning on meeting [[Brett Rawlings]] for coffee today and discussing our future plans for the growing operation with Benz. Updates to follow... 
- Didn't end up meeting with Brett yesterday which is not a bad thing, let me get some more work done which I would not have had time for and im still sturggling with my workload atm.
- The girls came over and we watched Enter the Dragon and had some drinks. Good times :) 


### ðŸ—“ Tomorrow, I need to...
Finish my weekly review.
