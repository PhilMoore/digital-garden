## 📕 How are you feeling today?
-   Tired and drained. Invited people over yesterday and Steph, Joel, Dan & Steve came over. Joel was in a weird mood and made the vibe horrible, didn't want to chat much or watch anything and overall just made it awkward. Since they left I felt a lot better and chilled with Steph who was a blast to hang with.
-   After all this thinking and work on personal development, goals and my time. I don't think nurturing a friendship with Joel is worth the time investment. I don't feel good 80% of the time after I see him and his comments, questions and behaviour take a tole on me as I spend the next day trying to make sense of it all.
