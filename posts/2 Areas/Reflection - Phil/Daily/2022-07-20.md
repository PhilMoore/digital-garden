## ðŸ“• How are you feeling today?
-   Hectic day, woke up after having a weird evening of having to kill 3 cockroaches downstairs and another got away.
-   Slept well considering but woke up feeling messy and paranoid.
-   Also had 3 meetings today and dave went for ages so put my day in a weird pace.
-   Replied to Callum annoyed about the choice to use slack. It was rash and snappy and I regret it even though it was not to bad.
-   NOTE TO SELF: Give yourself a cut off after long days. Donâ€™t keep checking messages, put the phone away and disconnect. Answering work or other messages at this time tends to lead to frustration or rash decisions.


## ðŸ’¡ Interest or activity of the day?
