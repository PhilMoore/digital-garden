## Daily Review

### ðŸ“• Day Log & Review
- Slept well and woke up before my alarm. Feeling sleepy and horny still but otherwise good for a Monday. Went to bed around 10:45pm I think. 
- Worked until 7:30pm today. Had a meeting with Callum and wanted to get on top of emails and also finish off properly as I had a lot of things open and unfinished. 
- Overall good day. Did not feel stressed and listening to a lot of Anjunadeep certainly helped. 


### ðŸ—“ Tomorrow, I need to...
Get on top of Casey's work. 
Do the Alida swimsuits
Reconcile Caliper accounts
Help Rachel
