# Weekly Review - 22nd July 2022 - Phil

## Reflection Work
---

### What went well?
---
-   Started a new routine and its helped us get meetings scheduled better together as our times are in sync in the morning.
-   Switched the team to using Element/Matrix as team communication which has proper threaded messages and that should help keep communicating with Harvey cleaner.
-   Started using Clockify & [Raycast (Alfred Alternative)](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/5e3c77b0-0959-11ed-8730-b244f95defbd) which integrate very well together, I feel this has improved my productivity and need to look into lockify more.
-   Spark email client is working better for me although has some issues with fonts and attachments, still not perfect.
-   Gave Harvey 10+ hours of work this week!
-   Met up with [[Henry Fahl]] to discuss giving him work.


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Start of the week I did not change my Fantastical meeting settings which lead to bookings at bad times.
-   Dave also took way longer than expected. I need to keep people on their appointed schedule to avoid throwing off my day.
-   Had some long days of work beyond when I should have finished
-   Puqpress Instagram went lots over its expected timeframe (but now allowing for more time).
-   Caliper back and forth with slack but now its settled on element.
-   Casey derailed my Friday with urgent last-minute gentle pit tasks which I don't feel I completed fully as I needed more info to complete this fully.


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Settle on a time tracking app going forward Timing or Clockify etc and get the team using the same app.
-   Get Rachel using Spark so we can work together on emails again.
-   Set an alarm to finish and make sure to check in with Rach on the day in the afternoon.
-   See if the team elements of [Raycast (Alfred Alternative)](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/5e3c77b0-0959-11ed-8730-b244f95defbd) are any good.
