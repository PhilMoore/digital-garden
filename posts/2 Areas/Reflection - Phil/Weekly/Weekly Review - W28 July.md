# Weekly Review - July 16th 2022 - Phil

## Reflection Work
---

### What went well?
---
-   Glowing reviews from Caliper staff.
-   Completed all the tasks I've set for this week (apart from a couple of minor ones)
-   Had good motivation throughout the week
-   Finally managed to help Rachel with [Blue Clay | Website & Rebrand Project](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/88dfb850-e3c6-11ec-b7c5-02d81509313b) and I'm in the loop with what's happening on this project now.
    
-   Delegated a bunch of work to Harvey which went well.

### What didn't go well?
---
-   Newton Mail is not working 100% as I would like it, many elements are not great and its making me spend more time in email than I'd like.
-   I ended up working 5 hours on Saturday to complete Caliper accounts
-   Too many tasks with days set as due dates, this is causing extra workload and stress moving them around.

### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Maybe make 3-4 mandatory day tasks part of my system and try not to create more than this, if there are overdue ones from today then they need to be focused on etc.
-   Find a better email client tomorrow and try to resolve more personal tasks and projects to allow more focus on work and rest.

## Reflection Personal

---

###   What went well?
---
-   Created goals for each area last Sunday with Rach.
-   Had a very productive weekend with Rach last weekend working on goals and project stuff.
-   Doing the above led us to have a heart-to-heart talk which has brought us both together this week.
-   Focusing on setting goals has helped me think more about what I spend my time on. Started to realise certain social circles are not as beneficial as others and now I'm a lot more focused on my personal projects and goals it's giving me justification for not seeing people as much.
-   Saw [[Stephanie MacNeill]] lots this week and went to martial arts training twice as well as doing yoga and stretching.
-   Overall feeling really good about spending time with the CC crew, we had a great Saturday train and brunch.
-   Had a great hang with [[James Thompson]] & [[Henry Fahl]] yesterday talking about goals and watching the new South Park streaming wars.    


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Ended up working long hours.
-   Did not play much [[Albion Online Links & Info]]]] at all.
-   Did not have any intimate time with [[Rachel Moore]]]


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Try to finish earlier and work a bit less if possible.
-   Try to give myself a break from extra projects beyond what I'm currently juggling
