# Reflection

Yes as I did not set any last week, this is technically the first week i have been using Obsidian full time.

## Reflection Work

### What went well?
- Using things 3 and Obisdian worked very well
- Time blocking was much faster and easier this week
- Setting 60min blocks to work in helped for spreading out some bigger projects
- Focused on clearing older Projects which helps, many are close to being done. 


### What didn't go well?
- Missed some emails in Assigned to me in Spark, need to check the list a bit more
- Distracted in the last few hours of the day for the past few days - productivity dropped off (could be due to working last weekend and most recent weekends)


### What can I do better next week?
- Try to rest more this weekend to I can feel fresher next week (which hopefully leads to better focus and productivity at the end of the day)
- Take more notes in clients projects

## Reflection Personal

###  What went well?
- Eating breakfast and lunch was really good for the week, saved money, starting to get used to it and I believe its probably healthier too.
- The above also helped a lot for training both on Saturday & Tuesdays sessions felt easier for me to concentrate and train. 
- Tracking tasks via Things has helped. 
- Was able to follow the evening routine well this week and i felt tired at 10-11pm most nights which helped me get good sleep.
- Meditation & Yoga was good this week, last week was better but still on track for Goals this week. 


### What didn't go well?
- Worked until late or didn't get much of an evening with Rachel sometimes due to stress from her work or other factors. 
- We didn't book our [[Trips & Adventures Planning]] last weekend, came up with ideas but didn't do it.
- Didn't read much this week in the evenings.


### What can I do better next week?
- Give myself a bit more of a cut off of doing stuff like Obsidian work on the weekends.
- Take a bit of a break before starting the next big project like our website for MD.
