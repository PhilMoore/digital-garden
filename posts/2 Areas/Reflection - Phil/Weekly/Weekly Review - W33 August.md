# Reflection
> [!QUESTION] How did last weeks goals go?
> Did you finish your goals from last week? What are you changing so that you can do them this month?

No I did terribly at this. Although I did smash out the migration of notes from Amplenote to Obsidian over the weekend.

I helped Rachel for around 3 hours, didn't quite get to 4.

Reading for around 30-40min was accomplished. If i can get another 20min today ill mark this as done.

## Reflection Work

### What went well?
- Better focus this week on the work instead of being distracted.
- Remained organised and found Obsidian catered to my workflow and work well this week. Essentially living out of Things 3 a lot which is nice.
- Got a lot of the accounts stuff for Caliper done too.
- Blue Clay website is starting to look good and take shape with the animations. 


### What didn't go well?
- Upwork developers taking too long to get work done, ended up cancelling the work of one to give it to the other. Riza is taking a long time with the Dreamgrow stuff still and Karl is finding bugs. 
- Did not start on the work I was expecting to this week. Pushed the MD website project further back and some projects I wanted to finish off like Reign and Alida still have some more work to go. 
- 


### What can I do better next week?
- Keep pushing on i suppose. I feel work is easing up and Rachels work on the BC website is almost done freeing her to start helping on other things. 
- Make more time to help Rachel.

- Had a very chill and relaxed Saturday with the Core Combat girls, going to Kali, breakfast then Looper.
