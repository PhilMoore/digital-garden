# Weekly Review - 29th July 2022 - Phil

## Reflection Work

---

### What went well?
---
-   Started using Clockify (another week another app) which has been really good for seeing team hours and timing, this will replace Timing going forward.
-   Starting using Raycast which has replaced Alfred fully and does lots more, helps with productivity a bunch.
-   Had a bit of a breakthrough yesterday regarding work business, charging more for all work will need to happen to clear shit clients, wrote about it here - [July 28th, 2022 | Moore Design New Rates / Day after D&D](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/72579650-0e11-11ed-b1ab-b244f95defbd)
-   Finished up with 2 Caliper clients - [Twinkledust | Links & Tasks](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/8afb88d0-fb9a-11ec-93aa-1a6318f2048a) & [Hannah Henry | Links & Tasks](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/69b8e538-fb99-11ec-97d6-ea4d774e4575)


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Not using projects well, took on a stupid WordPress project for [[Dreamgrow - Info & Tasks]] which I regret. I have too much work and I'm taking on more, no longer gonna be the case after this week.
-   Made a mess of Caliper accounts it seems, I'm not trained to handle VAT accounts and didn't to do it well. Ideally need to not do work I either don't want to do or can't do. This was supposed to be something for Harvey to do and get hours from but it turned into a bit more...
-   I did not help Rachel at all this week with work
-   Finding I’m running long on tasks Ives set 60min on.


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Not take on any new clients or projects - New project dates are now the 22nd of August at the earliest.
-   Use Projects in PARA more, to see what's current, what's being managed and what we've forgotten about or need to put more time into.
-   Email clients that we are putting up our pricing starting from the 1st of September
-   Focus on projects already started but which are near completion
-   For when I’m running long on tasks. Good idea to just set a timer or alarm for 55min to let me wind down the task at the end instead of running long.

-   Socialised a bunch and also went to Kali this week.
-   Had a good time at my party, just got a bit drunk and that fucked over my week a bit.

-   Did not run
-   Did not enjoy my evenings, both D&D and yesterday post-D&D where I had my focus on work as I was annoyed with how things are going.
-   Did not add any words to revise for Thai or practise at all.


### What can I do better next week?
