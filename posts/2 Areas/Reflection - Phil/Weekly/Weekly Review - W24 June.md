## Reflection

### What went well?
---
-   Feeling on top of work even though a lot of tasks were pushed day to day
-   Finished Gentle PIt UX UI
-   The call with Beyond Nine went well
-   New clients have given from Caliper and the relationship is going well
-   The Todo list is being reduced at a good pace
-   Went for a run üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-   Discovered new scheduling feature in Fantastical which should improve meetings


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Not allocating enough time for tasks on daily planner leading to pushing tasks, would be better to allocate more time and pull tasks from list if I finish early
-   Phils door2door email is not working
-   Have not actioned Gentle Pit's google search console tasks
-   Behind on actioning tasks from S&R
-   Unmotivated to do tedious work like google ads and search console


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Allocate more time for tasks and see how that works
-   Focus on work a bit more and have less distractions in videos, maybe more music or podcasts...
