# Weekly Review - 1st July 2022 - Phil

## Reflection
---


### What went well?
---
-   Heavy productivity and long hours to get lots of tasks done this week
-   Adapted well when important tasks where given
-   Got a bunch of Client sites very close to finished
-   Made huge progress on Caliper Accounts
-   Stayed focused and calm when growing venture with Brett crumbled
-   Overall very happy with how I managed work, clients and my productivity on my first week back from the holiday
-   Started using read later apps like Matter and Readwise + reading more on apple books


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Did not get many of the tasks I set for myself to do in the last few days
-   My relationship with Brett has ended
-   Didn't have much time in the evenings to relax or recover from the day
-   Drank way too much coffee to get work done
-   Did not do much yoga or any running this week


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Time block more time for bigger tasks that need doing, e.g. Accounts tasks might aswell get finished off while I'm in the flow then only spend a couple of hours on it and leave the rest for next week. Same for the Swatches today.
-   Try and work on a bit more work/life balance
-   Figure out updated business pricing on Monday and roll out to customers
-   Spend more time to read and start on [[PKM - Personal Knowledge Management]] tasks
