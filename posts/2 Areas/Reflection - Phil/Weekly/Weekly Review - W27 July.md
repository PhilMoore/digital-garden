# Weekly Review - July 8th 2022 - Phil

## Reflection Work
---

### What went well?
---
-   Researched & implemented [[The PARA Method - A Universal System for Organising Digital Information]] to Amplenote & Google Drive,  
    This led to a much better feeling of knowing what's currently active and not as well as where to save captured notes and what needs to be done.
-   Cleared a lot of tasks and over the hill with most of my projects leaving a lot of time to help Rach on [Blue Clay Website & Rebrand Project](https://www.amplenote.com/notes/88dfb850-e3c6-11ec-b7c5-02d81509313b)
-   Worked long hours and also started on the Google Drive PARA filling this week, started the week feeling like it was a lot but through putting in the time and not gaming or finishing early the week was very productive.


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Still got a bunch of projects waiting for clients like TV2YOU ads & Laurie
-   Did not review or update our Moore Design Pricing
-   Did not get or carve out much time to help Rachel with her work


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Ensure I have a better system to help Rach with her work. She's really struggling emotionally and under the workload.
-   Spend time with Rach to plan some goals to help her and train her on PARA so we can be more of a team again.
-   Finish off by setting up PARA and implementing Goals for areas.

-   Spend more time reading
-   Continue and build on Yoga progress
