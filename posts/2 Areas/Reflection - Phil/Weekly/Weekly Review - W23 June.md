# Weekly Review - June 10th 2022 - Phil

## Reflection
---

### What went well?
---
-   Good productivity and focus this week.
-   Cleared a lot of to-dos and got to a good point with GreenCNX.
-   Caliper is very happy with work and new clients are coming through.
-   Discovered a new screenshot and measuring tool which should help productivity going forward.


### What didn't go well?
---
-   Still lots of unfinished little things for clients that are waiting.
-   Puqpress did not hit 30k, posts are also having low likes, not sure if its hashtags, Instagram or just reusing the captions


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Aim to finish things off vs do a multitude of things that way there's less back and forth between clients day to day. (e.g. finish everything for UI/UX review in one day).
-   Do some work on crypto investments stuff or more design website. Otherwise, work out more.
