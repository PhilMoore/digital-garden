# Weekly Review - June 4th 2022 - Phil

## Reflection

---

### What went well?
Lots of work, new clients and managed to polish off a lot of the little tasks left over from last week.  
  
Also found the calendar feature/time blocking of Amplenote to be incredibly valuable, spent less time in emails and more time being productive and managing my work and business.


### What didn't go well?
GreenCNX is essentially on pause as communication between Brett and I has not been great and Brett wants to end the partnership.  
  
Otherwise Harvey did not design the Phil website as I asked him to, leading to more work required from me.


### What can I do better next week?
Keep focused and don't let the issues from this week affect my productivity
