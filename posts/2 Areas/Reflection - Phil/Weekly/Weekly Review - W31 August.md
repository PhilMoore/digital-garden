# Weekly Review - 5th of Aug 2022 - Phil

## Reflection Work

---

### What went well?
---
-   Outsourced a bunch of the WordPress and CSS work to other developers which lifted my workload.
-   I feel like I completed a bunch of projects or close to but my mind is drawing a blank, it's been a week.
-   WordPress CSS projects are basically complete too!
-   Calliper Accounts are filed and I avoided making a total mess of it. It was not smooth but it will be easier going forward.
-   Started doing more research on [[Obsidian Migration]] which I believe will be a better tool for the business and my second brain going forward, The lack of customisability of Anote, issues working together via tag and note ownership as well as some other little things are leading my to switch. The issue was figuring out how to break up the tasks, time blocking and notes element of it all which seems to be solved now if [[Things 3]] works out



### What didn't go well?
---
-   A bit of a mixed focus week, could be because of the number of hours earlier in the week as well as spending the weekend working on our goals.
-   Didn't get a chance to help Rachel so I'm working tomorrow on her stuff.


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Try focusing more on work, this week has been filled with lots of research into [[Obsidian Migration]] which I will go onto below in Personal.
-   Setting hard caps for Caliper communication out of hours, e.g. I will reply until 6, beyond that if it's urgent I will try to respond but can't promise anything.

## Reflection Personal

---

### What went well?
---
-   Started a new diet plan this week eating breakfast and not dinner, it worked out pretty well other than having 3 coffees a day which I feel might be more work-related. Will see how it goes over the weekend but ideally don't want as much coffee next week.
-   Stuck to our evening plan most nights which has allowed me to do reading and more yoga or chill with Rachel in the evenings.
-   Done A LOT more yoga and meditation this week than normal through our new plans.
-   Rach and I are still very strong relationship-wise.
-   We redid all the plants last week and they are looking great!


### What didn't go well?
---
-   A bit of a split focus between thinking about Obsidian and using Things 3, overall work was done but I feel I would have got at least 3-4 more hours of work completed. Kinda excited to move to something new though, definitely have shiny new tool syndrome at the moment.
-   We skipped Thai class and also did not do any Thai revision this week, slacking hard on the Thai front.
-   Also struggled to actually get to sleep at 10:40, closer to 11:30-12am most nights due to thinking about Obsidian etc.


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Spend the weekend catching up and helping Rach on work to help her stress out.
-   Try to focus a bit more on work while working.
-   Actually do Thai revision work.
-   Spend Sunday migrating all Clients and Projects to Obsidian and Tasks to Things 3, use the tool next week to work on and see if its gonna actually work for us or not. This will help me stop thinking about it if I'm actually using it I hope.
