# Weekly Review - May 27th 2022 - Phil

## Reflection

---

### What went well?
-   Started using Amplenote for the first week, its helped me focus in on projects more than just tasks which has helped me manage them better.
-   Spent more time with Rachel and at home vs going out to social events or training which has helped us bond better.


### What didn't go well?
-   Start of the week was very scattered with trying to find an app that worked for my needs.
-   Did not do much exercise like yoga and did not go to the park or do any MA training
-   Thai class was a mess, need an apple pencil and a system that works for leaning thai
-   Did close to zero work on GreenCNX and did not see Brett
-   Did not action Daves tasks or DCFridges shipping tasks


### What can I do better next week?
-   Focus on more GreenCNX work to get the shopify site at a good place
-   Spend more time on workouts/martial arts
-   Focus on clearing little projects like Dave & DCFridge to allow me to focus on the bigger projects later in the week.
