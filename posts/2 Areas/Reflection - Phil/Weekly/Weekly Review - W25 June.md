## Reflection
---

### What went well?
---
-   Got 95% of what I wanted to achieve this week done
-   Started on [[PKM - Personal Knowledge Management]] work on Amplenote
-   Glowing reviews from Casey & Caliper for my work
-   Ended the week feeling relaxed (thanks to our holiday)
-   I was better at allocating more time to tasks
-   I was less distracted while working (helps to only work 3 days...)


### What didn't go well?
---
-   I didn't finish everything I wanted to
-   Feeling slightly scattered regarding all the open projects at the moment although they are documented...
-   Did not action Gentle Pit Google Search console which is hanging around
-   Did not review the Thai glossary from the lesson
-   Did not get around to forming updated pricing for Moore Design


### What can I do better next week?
---
-   Actually Review Thai Glossary
-   Figure out updated pricing on Monday and roll out to customers
-   Schedule time for fitness
-   Schedule time for self development
