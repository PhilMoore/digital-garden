> [!question] Questions to ask
> Did you finish the initiatives? If so, how do you think you did? If not, what do you need to change to finish them this month?

Nope, this is my first monthly review, I'll set some this month to do by next month...


### Other reflections

It's been a very productive month, around a month since we started overhauling everything and trying to improve our systems. Also starting to see the fruits of this labour and cant wait to be all in on Obisidian.

> [!question] Questions to ask
> How do you feel about your accomplishments? What prevented you from working optimally?

Good, overall we've done very well. Some distractions in life with clients, friends and social obligations stopped us from being optimal however that is life and I feel these systems need to be able to withstand that. 

Overall Amplenote was letting us down for tasks and planning so the recent switch to [[Obsidian]]
 and [[Things 3]] has been very welcome.
