- Comes from the [Elemental Plane of Earth](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Plane_of_Earth) and is summoned by my crystal ring. 
- Genie name is **Vidre** who is a noble Genie which summoned me to his Palace in the Elemental Plane of Earth.
- Vidre speaks in a very ethereal and bassy tone. He has glowing crystalline elements through his body and 4 arms. His legs are not visible and the bottom half of his body tapers into a wispy point. 
- Vidre is a gready Genie hoping to gain more than he gives to Asher


#### Genie Attitude & Pact 
ATTITUDE: Your patron is the spirit of a long dead hero who sees your pact as a way to influence the world. 

TERMS OF THE PACT: You must occasionally conduct bizzare rituals to maintain your pact. 

RITUALS: 

- A ritual to take and bury rare/valuable things as a ritual for him to take and bring into his realm kinda thing.
- Gather some materials to perform a ritual and summon some minor earth elementals (like 1ft in height) to go off and do the genies bidding. I’m just assisting in bringing them to the material plane.
