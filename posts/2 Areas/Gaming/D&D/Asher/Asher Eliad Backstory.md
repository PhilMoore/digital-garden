## How it all began for Asher Eliad
Ashers mother **Leah** has heavily pregnant and on her way to [Waterdeep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Waterdeep) by carriage to give birth. On her way North to Waterdeep her water ended up breaking shocking her and the carriage driver as she was not due for another month according to the midwife. 

The carriage driver quirkily changed direction and headed to [Daggerford](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Daggerford) instead as it was only a few miles away. Upon arriving in Daggerford they pulled up the carriage up to a Tavern hoping to find someone inside who knew if there was a midwife in town that could assist Leah. However neither of them knew that there was not enough time... 

One of the barmaids rushed to the back to grab towels and sheets seeing that Leah was in no fit state to move anywhere right now. A short time later while she was going into in labour on the tavern floor, she saw a mug of wine behind the barkeep suddenly burst into flames, and every one in the tavern seemed to rejoice as Leah lost consciousness. 

Upon waking a few hours later, Leah found herself in one of the Tavern's room's with a midwife named Maya by her side who was holding a baby boy wrapped in towels and blankets. Maya then handed the baby boy to Leah and said to her that Tymora has smiled upon this child and he would live a blessed life.

Leah noticed that he was born with a small amount of pure white hair on his head which puzzled her as she had dark brown hair and his father had black hair with no knowledge of anyone in her family ever having white hair. 

Leah also remembered a mug of wine bursting into flames during the time she gave birth and mentioned it to the midwife Maya thinking this was something she imagined. Maya informed her that the Tavern she was staying in was known as the Lady Luck Tavern and that mug was actually Tymora's cup and this was a sign that Tymora was in the Tavern with us during the birth.

Leah looked released but also puzzled about what this meant. She was never a followed of Tymora but had heard many stories and songs about Lady Luck from travelling bards and other story tellers. 

Over the next day she decided to name her son Asher due to his Ash white hair and also to stay in Dagger fall for the foresable time as the child was born pre-mature and she wanted to stay close to the Tavern as she felt that her family was blessed by this turn of events. Leah also learned that Tymora herself had previously appeared in Daggerford many years prior, in form of a woman with white hair here leading her to know for sure that her son was trully blessed by the Devine.

Many years later Asher showed signs of having innate magical power and the healing potential of a cleric even as a young child. He also had the ability to bestow others with blessings of luck and cast minor spells and illusions. 

Asher was a child who could never sit still and liked to talk and was very persuasive. Once Asher reached his teenage years, Leah felt it was time to move on as Asher was always speaking with adventurers and repeating the stories they would tell him to Leah. He himself wanted to become an adventurer and travel the lands which filled Leah with worry. She felt moving closer to her family friends in Waterdeep would be wiser and allow Asher to experience the life of a bigger city where he would hopefully choose to settle in with her instead of leaving her for a life of Adventure.

Another 8 years had passed while they where in Waterdeep, Asher was very charismatic and loved to be around others. He also started playing the Violin after being mesmarised by its sounds and over the last 8 years became very good at it. In his early 20's he also started hunting bounties in the city learning that it could be quite fruitful career leading him to make friends and enemies. One such bounty was a Thief who was after a valuable trinket from a noble. Upon catching the Thief, Asher bound him and searched him before handing him over. He noticed the thief was wearing an interesting ring with a compartment which the noble who hired him was wearing, thinking that this was in fact stolen property he took the ring back from the thief and handed him over but chose to not return the ring to the noble saying that he did not find it on the thief. 

Asher was not certain why he choose to do this but he felt the ring was in a way calling to him but he could not figure out why or what it was....
