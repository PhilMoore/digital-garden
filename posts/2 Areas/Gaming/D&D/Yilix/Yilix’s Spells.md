# Yilix’s Spells

## Cantrips

### Magic Pebbles
On Yilix’s back (just above his right shoulder is a coffee grinder style funnel (with a locking lid) filled with pebbles leading down into a tube connected to the back of Yilix’s Scale Mail armour. The tube leads down and interweaves across his back leading to a turtle shell shaped box located on Yilix’s lower right side positioned slightly above a dump pouch attached to his belt. Yilix flips a switch on the bottom side of the box and quickly zaps and drops 3 energised pebbles into his dump pouch ready for collection. There is also a secondary pressure switch on the inside of Yilixs left fingerless glove which zaps and drops a single pebble and winds up a vibrating clock within the box for a timer of 55 seconds.

As the charged pebbles are dropped the pebbles at the top of the hopper start funnelling down the tube.


### Guidance
Connected to Yilix’s inner left bracer is a narrow waterskin leading to a syringe style end perfectly placed to pump a small gel into Yilix’s palm. This syringe pump is triggered by a pressure pad built into Yilix’s left fingerless glove. The gel is transparent and also evaporates into an odourless gaseous form after a minute.


## 1st Level Spells

### Cure Wounds
Steampunk style asthma inhaler connected to a breathing tube. This dispenses a soothing zesty mist once a button is pressed on its side.

This device works based on cartridges that are spent after each use.


### Tasha’s Caustic Brew
On the Yilix’s left shoulder is a stubby ornate clockwork tube shaped like a small canon with a translucent pipe with a luminous green liquid within it. This is connected Yilix’s Scale Mail and interweaves with the pebble tube along Yilix’s back to another turtle shell style box positioned on Yilix’s lower back hip area. On the underside of this turtle shell box is a covered button on which pressures the tube and triggers cannon to dump the luminous green liquid in a straight line once the button is released.
