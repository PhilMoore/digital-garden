_Life force in Faerun is know as the weave. This is what enables magic_.

## Gnomes

_Gnomes from Lantan are known as the Lantana or Lantanese and are secretive since the great disaster_. _They have isolated their 2 main islands from the outside world._ (Kinda like Japan in the edo period)

Gnomes are known as the forgotten folk, the were i slaves by other races for generations(first by the kobolds). Gnomes hate kobolds. Gnomes believe that they came from gems in the world and they love to accumulate gems. Diamonds became rock gnomes, emeralds became forest gnomes and rubies became deep gnomes. Legend has it that gems opened like flowers and gnomes where born as their pollen. Gnomes are industrious, don’t have many enemies and like to live life under a low profile. Gnomes have not participated in many wars or conquer lands. This is why they are known as the forgotten folk. Gnomes average over 3ft tall and weigh around 40lbs / 20kg. They love life and cherish every moment they have.

**Types of Gnomes:**

**Rock Gnomes:** Are the most common gnomes. They enjoy life in all its ways, from work to play to study, these gnomes are all about the journey. They are often city dwellers, technicians, inventors, miners, crafters, alchemists, tinker gnomes and more dwarf like but not as greedy. Very mechanically minded and has the ability to understand magic.

Rock gnomes call the island or Lantan their homeland, it is north of the Chultan Peninsula and is the home of the largest population of Gnomes in Fae Rune. It is an island of wondrous invention and bustling commerce.

It was in the Island of Lantan where Gond, the god of invention appeared to the world as a gnome. Many young rock gnomes took this as a sign that it was time for the gnomes to invent a new way of life. Gunpowder originates in this island. The secret of firearms was bestowed to the gnomes on this island for sheltering him during this time of troubles.

Gunpowder is banned in many cities, but the church of Gond in Lantan freely manufactures smoke powder.

Rock Gnomes look like WoW gnomes and steampunk style, can also be pretty small

**Forest Gnome:** Into nature, shy and reclusive very Fae like, secretive and uses lots of illusions. The most mischievous and secretive, not as common but popular in the Fae wild. They want others to enjoy the first as much as they do.

**Deep Gnomes:** Live in the under dark but are not mean and nasty like Dark Elves. They live their entire lives underground. Very guarded and suspicious creatures, don’t trust people easily. Very good at mining and have dark grey skin. Born bald and can’t grow hair


## Rock Gnome

Very curious and wants to learn everything about everything. Very clever and very cunning but also whimsical.

Lives a long time from 300-500 years old. (Mature gnomes 40yo +).

Talks a lot with very little space between their words. Speaks very quickly. Feels like there’s never enough time to do everything.

(Rock gnomes are more serious in nature.)

Hair sticks out and mischievous tendencies (Mary & Pippin esque from LOTR). Used to living underground. Gnomes tend to stick to their own communities which are secretive but are excepted in the world.


## Tips to play a gnome

Gnomes like to work together and live together. They have a strong family base and identify themselves as part of a co-operative family even in their adventuring group. **They ask a lot of questions, is optimistic and adventurous.** Gnomes love to party and live every day like it’s their last.

(Think 12 year old, wide eyed optimist, who’s fascinated about everything and wants to know all they can).

_Likes to be warm, caring and supportive character._ _**Yilix is focused and fun, light hearted and eager seeking for knowledge**_**. He loves to travel and learn about each area of the world first hand (and make some coin while he’s at it)**.

_Yilix worships the god Gond and always looks for a temple of Gond in big cities to pay his respects, catch up with the latest news and use the workshops on offer for his tinkering._ Gondites believe that magic is a tool to further their creativity. Gond is known as the wonderbringer. Gond care only for acts of creation. Gond is a true neutral god Yilix is neutral good. Temples to Gond tend to be imposing stone structures with boxy shapes and with pillars. Gond is fascinated by making the theoretical reality.

_Yilix likes to spew out ideas and thinks fast (3-5 sentences ahead) and acts with a lot of energy when not lost in thought over his next invention._

He normally can’t be seen when standing at a counter for being served at a human tavern or inn.

With arm length they can generally reach to 4ft. Make sure to role play this height element to reach up to open doors or windows and overcome the fundamental problem of height.

They relish the idea that most buildings are twice the size of the ones they have back home giving them more space at the same price.

_Yilix has a telescopic grappler that he has invested to help him reach and point to things normally out of his reach_
