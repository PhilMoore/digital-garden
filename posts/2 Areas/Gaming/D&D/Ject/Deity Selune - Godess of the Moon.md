# Words of Selune

_Let all on whom my light falls be welcome if they desire to be so. As the silver moon waxes and wanes, so too does all life. Trust in my radiance, and know that all love alive under my light shall know my blessing. Turn to the moon, and I will be your true guide._

— Selune

These words are the words uttered to Ject when Selune first appeared to him outside of her temple. He has only heard this once but he remembers them as if he had to study them for a lifetime.
