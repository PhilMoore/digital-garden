# Ject’s Backstory
![[Ject - Avatar.png]]

Ject’s father had a large collection of books and was an agent of the Harpers, the village Ject grew up in was in fact a cell of the Harper faction. Ject was never aware of this, to him it was a normal village. Ject had also never travelled beyond the local lands and the outskirts of the nearby forest.

At a young age, Ject was fascinated by the night sky. Growing up in Telive (made up small village) he was the child of the town mayor and was home schooled at young age. He gained a thirst for knowing more but was limited by the books which where available to him in his small town. He read about academies in distant lands and aspired to become a scholar, a scientist or even an astrologist (but this was not his destiny). One afternoon, when Ject was only 14 Ject, wandered away from town with his father's bedroll, and supplies to camp out for the night as we wanted to get away from the town to get a better view of the stars.

At close, to midnight as he was gazing at the night sky when he noticed smoke obscuring his view of the stars. He stood up and saw a light in the direction where his town was. It was as if the town was having a large bonfire celebration that we were not aware of. Ject spent a short while, packing his things and starting the journey back to the village as this fire had perked his curiosity.

Upon returning home his whole town was destroyed, his family was killed and their house set a blaze. With no worldly possessions other than what he had on his back, Ject rummaged through what remained of the town to fill his pack with rations, equipped himself with a rusty short sword and fled to [Tsurlagol](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tsurlagol).

Here he found work at the local dock and around the city as well as taking trips to the nearby city of [Procampur](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Procampur). Part of his earnings paid for the room at the orphanage. 5 years later Ject was stronger, and gained the street smarts necessary to stay alive in the Pirates Haven that he found himself in.

One morning at the docks, Ject found himself in an unfortunate situation, he was caught red handed while trying to steal from a travelling merchant, at first it was only going to be some coin to buy food, however in this merchants bag he found an insignia that resembled something he’d seen in his house a child. Unfortunately for Ject, this merchant was actually a faction agent for the Harpers and followed Ject and cornered him in a nearby alley. “Got something of mine” he said before reaching out and pinning Ject to the wall. Ject panicked and froze. “Don’t worry the man said, I just want what’s mine, give it back to me and I’ll buy you some breakfast.” Ject reached and gave the man his coin pouch and insignia back. The man said, “do you even know what this is?” Ject replied, “no, but I’ve seen it before when I was a kid”. The man introduces himself to Ject as Gemil Cloudrunner and buys Ject breakfast while also offering Ject a job to assist him with carrying some of his goods. Ject accepted.

A few weeks later Ject realised that there was something not quite normal with this merchant's way of conducting business. Later that evening Ject speaks to Gemil of his findings and Curitiba knows more about what he’s actually doing in these lands as he’s clearly more than just a merchant. “I’m surprised you figured it out,” Gemil said, “I actually work for the Harpers, that’s the insignia you stole from me. Good thing I took it back or you might have been killed. We don’t have many agents in this territory anymore”.

At this point the penny dropped for Ject, the moment brought up intense memories of the insignia at his family home and around his town. This was followed by the memory of his family home burning and his town scattered with the dead bodies of the townspeople. He was the only one who survived in his town.

Ject spoke to Gemil “what happened to the agents you had here?”

Ject learns of the naibourng factions and the political tension of the region, the harpers were once very prominent in this region but now the Zhentarim control the area. The man was sent to gather new intelligence on the region.

Ject opened up to the Gemil about his knowledge of the insignia, and the town where he grew up. He said that he was out of town gazing at the stars when the town was attacked and no one was left standing. Since then he’s been picking up work and at times living on the streets of Tsurlagol.

Once Gemil learned it this information, he felt he had a duty to offer Ject the opportunity to join the Harpers and train him with the skills necessary to survive in this line of work. Ject accepted wanting to learn more about what led to the destruction of his village and he also felt that the skills he would learn in this faction could also greatly assist him in possibly taking up the life of adventuring one day.

(Fast forward 10 years)

Ject has been a faction agent rising up the ranks since the start of his 20s - 10 years now. A lifetime for this type of lifestyle. He spent most of this time travelling with Gemil around the Sea of the fallen stars, the dragonreach sea and in later years around the Moonsea.

In a recent mission Ject, Gemil and some other agents were trying to infiltrate a Zhentarim stronghold in the area however this mission went south, and Gemil was killed in action along with a couple of other Harper agents. Luckily Ject made it out alive however he was not feeling himself after losing Gemil who at this point became a father figure to him.

Ject feel into a period of depression after this turn of events and started contemplating what his future could look like… He wanted to get out of the faction game and all the politics that go with it. After all, it’s led to the death of his whole village, countless other agents he’s met along his travels and now Gemil.

Ject made his arrangements to leave in secret, get on a boat at dawn bound south-east towards the Dragonmere sea I n order to start a new life. However, this was not his destiny. The afternoon before he was due to board this ship was an interesting one … leading towards the golden hour and twilight Ject was entranced by the full moon during an afternoon stroll and was mindlessly led to the temple of Selune. Ject turned to go back at this point and in the span of 12 seconds, he started to see every light in the area gradually fade to a low dim and then he was plunged into total darkness.

Ject was never one to be scared of the dark, especially considering his line of work, however, this was different it was a soothing, safe kind of darkness. Out of this darkness, a voice emerges turning up the lights from behind Ject. The voice of a celestial sounding woman said “This is a safe space, turn to me and listen, I have much to tell you”. Puzzled Ject turns around to face the temple once more where he sees the goddess Selune appearing as a dusky-skinned human woman with long limbs; perfect and exquisite beauty; wide, radiant, lime-green eyes; and long, ivory-hued hair that fell to her knees.

Selune speaks “_Let all on whom my light falls be welcome if they desire to be so. As the silver moon waxes and wanes, so too does all life. Trust in my radiance, and know that all love alive under my light shall know my blessing. Turn to the moon, and I will be your true guide.”_

She pauses and speaks again

“Your time in these lands is not over yet, you will need to remain in your line of work for a little longer. I know your destiny, I see your potential. And that Ship you were planning to board won’t make it to its destination. [Umberlee](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Umberlee) has joined with Shar to overpower the powers of the light at sea. “

Ject’s feet begin to raise off the ground and his body begins to gravitate towards Selune as she turns and starts to walk inside her temple.

Shortly after both Selune and Ject are inside the temple she waves her hand in the direction of the altar and an ornate silver star shaped metallic object levitates and floats to wards Ject.

“Take this gift.” Selune speaks and pauses. “This will serve as your divine focus.”

As Ject picked up the symbol of Selune. At this point he started to see a vision of himself with a band of adventures facing a giant black spider. Ject saw himself in the vision holding on to this same ornate star, he then speaks saying the words “Selune guide my light” and a bolt of light strikes down on the spider. This vision of events shocked Ject as he’s never had any skills in the arcane so far in his life. Returning to the vision Ject also noticed that his vision self was also fully capable of seeing in darkness and emanating the aura of dim light which seemed to be assisting his allies in combat. Fast forwarding rapidly he senses feelings of danger and pain, but this pain is short lived. Ject can see himself from the 3rd person, has a much grander version of this symbol and he’s in darkness, feeling safe, calm and at home. His future self descends into this crypt following his companions and the vision jumps forward again.

![[Ject - Avarar 2.jpeg]]

The voice returns “ I’ve yet to even show you the basics of the power I will bestow on you. For my champions, stewards and guardians are few but elite”.

“Become my cleric and aid me in my fight against Shar.” The vision flashes forward.

Ject looks a few years older stronger and with that grin that he thought he lost. He looked in his element. To which point he started to fly up and to an elevated point in the city he was in. Landing at the top he turned invisible as he started drawing his sword.

She pauses

“I have been watching you for a while, you’re wise but I have a mission for you that will make you wiser, follow my guidance and complete my tests. Don’t waste your potential. Arrive at this spot tomorrow at twilight, say (the owls are early tonight) and take a seat in the cart. “

When Ject spoke to Selune asking what the goddess was expecting in return for his help she answered “that she is waxing back into full strength and requires assistance to thwart Shar's follower's dark plots and restore the light of the moon. This will be a long journey filled with many hardships for you. I will do my best to prepare you for the path ahead granting you more gifts as you prove your faith and dedication to me and my followers.”

“For now I need you to rest. Don’t worry about your contacts in this town, I will ensure that your faction is aware that you will be away and travelling West. All will be explained by the guardian you will meet in the [Zhentil_Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentil_Keep) .”

Ject snapped out of his vision, sitting inside the temple with the symbol in his hand. He was unsure whether to throw it or pack it in I's pocket when a priest of the temple emerges. He says, “I think it’s time for you to head back and rest up. Tomorrow is your last day in [Thentia](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thentia). Ject decided to pocket the symbol but did so slightly so the priest did not see. He stood up and looked at the exit, he then turned round to see the priest was gone and begins to walk back to his room.

He spends the day watching ships leave the dock and contemplating the events of the previous week evening questioning Selunes motives, what she saw in him and what should he do as instructed by her. He also resumes his day to day activities as an agent of the Harpers, gets dinner and some wine from the local tavern and proceeds back to his room to gather his belongings. Thinking to himself, what have I got to lose following Selune if I was defined to die today if this encounter didn't happen last night. He then proceeded back to the temple, gets on the cart and speaks the words to the driver. As the cart leaves the town, Ject is told he’s starting his training but first, we also need to meet with Asmon (a human cleric of Selune) in the [Zhentil Keep](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Zhentil_Keep) before heading to a field camp outside of the city where the ruins of an old crypt are. Here his cleric training begins…

One week later during an evening stroll in a nearby field under the light of a full moon, a will-o-wisp appears to him. The wisp begins to channel the voice of Selune, pulsing brighter as each word was spoken and dimming down during Selunes pauses of silence. Ject’s next task is to continue to travel west to [Thultanthar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Thultanthar) also known as the City of Shade. ￼Your first mission is to meet with an eleven paladin of the moon known as Psyto he is arriving to this camp and will require your assistance for his mission in Thultanthar.

Ject is still unsure that his newfound powers are real, that all of this is real. But he collected his thoughts and the moment he touched the star he was gifted with his anxiety faded.

Ject was never the religious type but after all the events that transpired in his life, he’s never had anything like this happened to him. He now started to feel less depressed and with a drive to satisfy his needs of Selune. Ject started to warm to the Selune faith, it’s been the predominant religion in these lands but he never really knew that much about beliefs until recently and he liked what he heard.

During the days preparing for the mission Psyto and Ject formed a close bond, Ject was impressed with the calibre of people that he had met since starting to follow Selune. However, this friendship was to be short lived. During the mission, Psyto became overconfident and decided to follow the apprentice lich while he was running away from the fight. Ject helped up the other Shar supporters from pursuing while Psyto went ahead and chased the apprentice down. After Ject dealt with the other supporters in the fight he pursued the path that Psyto took in order to help him against the apprentice, however upon catching up to them he found the Apprentice lich winning the fight and Psyto was worse for wear. Psyto was in a very bad state after numerous curses and did not have the strength to keep fighting. He knew his time was up and that Ject was also in need of some healing. Psyto motioned to Ject to stand next to him, where he used up the last of the healing available to him to patch up Jects wounds so he could stand a better chance at smiting this apprentice Lich.

Ject gave it all he had and came out victorious, however, this would not have been possible if not for Psyto’s healing. Upon slaying the Lich, Ject returned to Psyto where he tried to stabilise him from dying with his skills in medicine however this was not enough, the Paladin had a dark curse on him bleeding him dry and sucking out the life force from his body. Psyto’s dying action was to raise the moon blade he had which was a family heirloom that was passed by generations in Psyto’s family. Psyto did not want this blade to go into the enemy's hands and had faith that even though Ject was only a human, he was blessed by Selune and could one day unlock the powers of this blade. Ject was stunned and disappointed at his inability to save Psyto, he took the blade and promised him he would devote himself to Selune and her cause now realising that fighting for Selune against the powers of darkness was far bigger than anything he had experienced while working for the Harpers. He took the blade, and a few of Psyto’s cherished belongings which he was planning on sending to his family and escaped the City of Shade. His mission was completed but with a heavy loss.

Once this mission in the City of Shade was over, Ject continued to travel west, passing Llorkh, Loudwater, Secomber then finally ending in WATERDEEP for his next mission.

In WATERDEEP Ject’s mission is to access his network of faction contacts for information, he was instructed by Selune to stay in the inn known as [Selunes Smile](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sel%C3%BBne%27s_Smile) (an inn and tavern in the city) and to speak to the high priest at the [House of the Moon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/House_of_the_Moon) (the biggest temple of the Selune faith in WATERDEEP). At the temple, Ject was impressed by the grandeur of the temple and found that he was no longer resistant to this clerical path that he has been placed on. He was particularly taken by the Wand of Four Moons. As he was gazing at it a priest spoke from behind him “impressive isn’t it?”, Ject turned to see a tall elderly elven priest who’s clearly been around for hundreds of years. “Is this a replica?” Ject asked. Which lead to a smile on the Elven priest who then started recounting the story of when Selune was Luna and the day that she fought against Shar over WATERDEEP. After this story, Ject mentioned to the priest that he was here under the instructions of Selune herself to come here and formally join the church of Selune. At this point, Ject reached into his pocket and took out the silver star he was given by Selune. The priest grinned with excitement, “our ranks are growing he said, it seems Selune has been at work recruiting members to our faith. Follow me, we need to speak with the high priests of the temple.

Ject’s training was furthered for a few days by some of the clerics of the church. He was thought to use Guidance, Toll the Dead, Detect magic and many other healing skills and abilities in the school of Lunar magic. He also briefly thought some of the people about the history of the Temple of the moon and the Selunite faith.

Ject exceeded the expectations of his teachers in the temple to the point where his instructors decided to put Ject on his next assignment where he could further his clerical training. The first option he was presented with was to go to work in the All Faiths shrine in Red Large. The other option he was presented with was to go help the people of Neverwinter Wood. Ject was briefed that the flora and fauna of the area were suffering under what appeared to be an unnatural frost plague that has been intensifying in the woods there. Trees and animals are suffering from the cold and the biome is changing to a colder type.

Being the adventurous type Ject chose to assist the people of Neverwinter forest to no surprise of his mentors. The House of the Moon sent word to the local stables to prepare a horse for ject to use for his journey to Neverwinter. The next day he said his farewells to the temple and began his journey to the Jewel of the North, only briefly stopping at [Leilon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Leilon) for a night of rest and he camped the rest of the way.

Ject arrives at Neverwinter the evening before our campaign begins. He stayed the night at [Driftwood Tavern](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Driftwood_Tavern) where he found himself interested in the adjacent museum, the innkeeper [Madame Rosene](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Madame_Rosene) noticed Ject’s curiosity and introduced Ject to some of the cliff notes of Neverwinter’s history, she also saw that he was always reading while eating and recommended that if he was interested in learning more about the city a great book to learn would be The City of Neverwinter and directed him to a bookstore in the city which had a few copies.

### Ject’s tale of loss

It was a cloudy evening as Psyto and I left camp to start our mission to infiltrate the fortifications at the outskirts of where the Thultanthar (the city of shade) once was. This was to be my first mission for Selune to put my first few weeks of cleric training to the test.

This mission was simple. Infiltrate the fort and put an end to the Lich serving Shar. However, things did not go as planned. Psyto my elven companion was a paladin of Selune, who I was tasked to assist. He was young but full of charm. During our missing, we infiltrated the keep, found our way to the Lich and fought off his supporters. Psyto chased Lich and I covered his retreat and fought off the remaining Shar supporters. Once my fight was won I rushed in the direction of where Psyto went and saw him mortally wounded. With his remaining power, he healed my wounds so I could stop the ritual the Lich was performing.

Thanks to the power bestowed on me by the silver goddess I ended the Lich with two well-placed guiding bolts and a swing of my maul. I gave it my all and it would not have been enough if it wasn’t for Psytos healing.

The moment the Lich fell to the ground I rushed to stabilise Psyto knowing there wouldn’t be much time before he lost too much blood to stabilise him. The Paladin had a dark curse on him draining out the life force from his body. Psyto’s dying action was to raise his moon blade which was passed by generations in Psyto’s family. Although I was only human, Psyto trusted me with this heirloom which shocked me. I had only known him for a few weeks however our bond was strong and I vowed to never forget him and promised him I would fully devote myself to Selune and her teachings in order to protect my comrades from the darkness and fight for those who cannot protect themselves. I took the blade, and some of Psyto’s cherished belongings to send back to his family and escaped the fort. His mission was completed but with a heavy loss.
