## Twilight Sanctuary

Ject holds his holy symbol and utters the words "_Goddess Selune, protect my comrades and bring them safely to the new dawn_" and a silver shimmering aura pulses out of Ject in a bubble around him

Prepare spells equal to my WID modifier + Cleric Level.

Class is inspired by witch hunters and vampire hunters - Think Van Helsing

Thor - More of a tempest cleric

Joan Of Ark

Melasandre (GoT) Thoros of Mir (GoT) - Light Domain

Think undead slayer / necromancer hunter

> Always remember that this charecter has Faith In A Higher Power (does not have to be unconditional) - **Look up secrets in Xanthars guide for clerics**

### Ject in 2 Words - Faithful, Idealist

---

### Personality Traits (choose 1 or 2)
-   I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other factions and condemn their ideals.
-   I've spent so long as a faction agent on solo missions that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.


### Ideals (choose 1 that fits with your alignment)
-   Faith. I trust that my deity or the ideals of my faction will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)
-   Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by matching my actions to their teachings. (Any)


### Bonds (choose at least 1)
-   I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.


### Flaw (choose at least 1)
-   My idealism sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess beliefs that match my faction ideals.
-
