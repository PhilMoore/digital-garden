# Neverwinter

Iliyasha Guiding Star - contact in NW

Embassador to Neverwinter for the Illiyabruen elves of the Fae Wild

Serine = Selune but Fae version.

Need to recover articfacts

**New Sharendar** - Where Vylus and Gillis are from.

Leave her a sign under the waterfall

1.  White Skull of Cryovein

Must be returned to the white star - Both artefacts are to be brought to NW.

1.  The Globe

Metal box lined with Lead. (DO NOT TOUCH THE GLOBE) Put it in the box and bring it here.

Orb has limited magical properties unless powered with something like the Skull. It’s being used to augment the impact of the frost plague.

Sildar Hallwinter - Friend of Alveris (James) and introduced him.

Gathir - Alidri person with Vylus and Gillys.

2 nights ago part of cryovein was sold to someone with nefarious purposes. They are using it to power the small orb artifcat. This is what’s calling more cold and frost power to the area.

Scouts have tracked them to Backwater Inn (travellers Inn) 1/2 day journey into the NW woods - rush job due to the ritual.

2 routes:

-   1 days journey
-   Cut through the wood to be there in 1/2 a day.

Buyer is working for a Woman, they do not have large numbers. If the globe is being used it might twist or corrput creatures.
