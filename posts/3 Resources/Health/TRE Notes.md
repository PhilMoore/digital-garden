# **How to practice TRE at home:**
-   Practice TRE a maximum of 2-3 x times a week  
-   Not 2 days in a row  
-   Max 10-15 minutes of shaking/tremors each time.  
-   Set a  timer to be able to relax and focus on following signs from your body, not the amount of time you are tremoring.  
-   Pause and ground whenever you feel a need to.  
-   The shaking can be as little as 1 minute at times as well.  
-   Here is a video with the exercises by the founder Dr. David Bercelli:  
    [https://youtu.be/FeUioDuJjFI](https://youtu.be/FeUioDuJjFI)  
-   We have also attached the official TFA (TRE For All) document outlining instructions for the seven primary exercises in the TRE Process.  

**Remember:**  
-   You do not want to feel that life becomes too hard practicing TRE, overly strong emotions, hard managing your job, feeling very stressed, etc.  
-   You want to keep it at a grounded relaxed and releasing level as we did during our Module 1 training this weekend.  

**Polyvagal Curve and Grounding Numbers  
**Take a few deep breaths and allow yourself to settle into your present physical sensations and breathing pattern.

### _Begin to ask yourself:_  
_Where am I in the polyvagal curve?_  

If you imagine a scale of 0-10 in the Polyvagal Curve where:  

### **Number 0-3**  
Is the Ventral Vagal - Parasympathetic “Calm” (Green Zone) the grounded and calmer levels of being present in your thoughts, emotions, breaths, and the tension in your body-mind?  

### **Numbers 4-7**  
Is the Sympathetic Nervous System - Sympathetic “Flight or Fight” (Red zone). 

The activated, agitated, frustrated, irritated, and angry part of our autonomic nervous system causes us to fight or flee from a situation. 

### **Numbers 8-10**  
Is the Dorsal Vagal Parasympathetic “Disconnected” (Blue Zone).  

Here you are dissociated and disconnected from your mind-body connection to various degrees.  

This can often happen in lighter instances when we get stuck in front of a television or computer for hours and forget or do not notice the body's signals for hunger, thirst, sleep, or the need to go to the bathroom.

# Day 1
TRE Works to regulate the Vagus nerve
![[Health - TRE Polyvagal Curve Numbered.jpg]]
Green & Blue = Parasympathetic Nervous System
Red = Sympathetic Nervous System

### Trauma
- Either a big event in life where you think of events as pre-x happening in life and post-x happening in life.
- Can also be a small series of stressful things leading to a form of Trauma.

### Self Regulation
- Use the picture chart above of the `Polyvagal Curve` in relation to the numbers/zones and Conduct a thought exercise to notice feeling and what I'm like when I'm in a different zone, e.g. if in an agitated state, what can i do to get grounded?  Or if I'm angry, tapping or massaging might not work to ground so other tools should be used to help. 
- Singing or humming is also a form of self massage to calm + ground myself. 

## Beginning signs of activation
- Holding breath
	- Notice this and breathe through it.
- Tensing, jaws, neck, hands or feet
- Increased HR
- Sweating on hands or upper lips
- Nausea 
- Headaches
- \Noticing myself drifting off or not engaged to something. 


### What to do?
- Stretch the body, lock out the knees or legs.
- Ask for help
- Roll over to the side
- Push self up and sit if laying

## Exercises to trigger tremors
- Moving sides of feet while the foot is planted in one stop to left and right for 3 breaths on each side. Repeat this series 3x.
- Calf Raises on each leg until a lvl 7 of tension (out of 10)
- Bending over and working on stretching inside of thighs until a level 7. Do a forward bend, next go to the left foot, then right foot and then back to the middle and try to go deeper.
- Have one leg in front of the other and hands closer to to the front leg just beyond the front foot. Squat up and down in this state without having the knee go over the front foot. Do this until a lvl 7 of tension
- Back against the wall and squat while being able to see toes and work to a tension of 7 then move up 2 inches until you feel tension again. In this exercise you are stationary holding the weight in your legs while back is resting flat on the wall. This can be repeated 3-4 times.
- Final exercise is laying down legs in butterfly and hips off the ground a few inches. Work to hold this untl a tension of 7 and then move the legs a bit more forward and repeat. Can do this 3-4 times working to having flat feet and angled legs while still remaining laying down. 


# Day 2

#### Lymphatic System
![[Health - Lymphatic System.jpeg]]

#### Nervous System
![[Health - Nervous System.jpeg]]

## Neurogenic tremors 

These tremors are part of a instinctual procedure memory in the human animal, the body elicits them to complete the process discharge of the aborted intrinsic movement pattern of fight and  defence.

They are part of brain stem activity 

## Autonomic nervous system 

![[84321647-145F-4E60-86FC-E89865F79199.jpeg]]

Voluntary nervous system 
- excersise
- Playing games
- Walking 
- Driving 


Autonomic -
- sweating
- Pupil dialatiom 
- Skin flushing


Sympathetic Nervous System - Speeds up System - Contraction
- Speeed up System 
- Contraction
- Striumaltes fight and flight
- Increases adrenaline 
- Shuts down digestion
- Tighten muscles.
- Syemptoms
	- Lesss sleep
	- Shuts down digestion
	- Increases adressnalin
	- Sweating
	- Feeling hot.

Parasympathetic 0Slows Down System - Expansion
 - Softens muscles
 - Rests and relaxes
 - Regenerates and recouperates. 
 - Triggers digestion


### Neurogenic Tremors
Triggered by postures through a little bit of tension, however are stronger when relaxed. 

Wide distribution that happens all over the body, not just in the muscles used in the excersises. 
Vary in amplitude and frequency. 

Usually more movement = less fast and frequent.
More movement is also incorporating more Fasca movement.


In medical science, Neurogenic tremors are documented in Panic Attacks (trembling and shaking), Social Phobia (tremors in agoraphobia), generalised anxiety disorder (trembling or feeling shakly), PTSD (trembling). 

The science of psychology has viewed body tremors as a part of the pathological expression of the disorder. 

The nerutohenic tremors of TRE are recognised as the neurophssiological attempt of the human organism to release tension and trauma. 

### Physiology of Tremors

Rhythmic Neu\ruomuscular Stimulation (RNS) method is a technique that todays vibration methodology is based on dates back to the 1960s. This stimulation is benefitial for joints. 

Tremors are used to correct restricted body mobility and improve range of motion. It also increases the rate of healing injuries 

### Pathological Tremors 
(Not triggered by TRE but through something else like a pathogen)

Essential Tremors - Most common ones of these are genetic in.

Parkinsonian Tremors - Seen a t rest and decreases with voluntary movement. 

Cerebella Tremor - MS, Brain stem tumour, strokes

Enhanced Phycological Tremor - Normal Tremors which are increases when anxious, medication or metabolic conditions. 

### Tremorgenesis
The aren't of creating Tremors in the body. 

- A certain level of tension (like we do in our excersises) is what's needed to get the body to start working and tremoring to release the tension.

- For example starting to move your leg consciously as fidgeting can later 

Efforent - (remember by eating which starts at the top and goes down) - Moves signals down the body from the brain.

Afforrent -Messages moving from the muscles or lower body to the brain. This is the type of excersizes which trigger the body to start TRE tremors. 


Generators of Tremors and anatomical PAthwats 
- Several brain areas play a role in tremorgenesis
- Tremors rely on communication between the Afforent and Efforent systems. 


#### Nausea, Fear, Anxiousness during Tremors
- Allow the body to go to a place of fear, nausea or anxiousness and then STOP. 
-  Leave the body some time to check in and process what has come up instead of pushing through.
- Take a walk, ground and drink water if this happens. 
	- Can come back and try again.
	- If fear or anxiousness come back, STOP again and wait more time.

#### Laughing and criying
Don't get hooked on stuck on the memory or story, see it as energy release it. Body will stop crying or laughing when it needs to.

#### Tired
Opening up a place of deep tension can lead to tiredness. Stop and allow the body to recover before starting again. 
- Follow the tiredness and exhaustion.
- Don't push through!
- TRE does not create it, it only reveals what is there. 

### Psycology vs Neurology in TRE

- Psycology - Is all about the content of the brain or the experience of the story
- Neurology-  is the way or curing or releasing the stress or energy through more exercises vs being able to talk it out. This works well if it is a trauma or stress locked in the brain stem which is normally hard to access or relate when thinking of healing via psycology. 

# Day 3

### Psoas Muscle

One of the main muscles in TRE as it connects the upper body with the lower body. 
We can work it out doing leg raises, stretch it switch up dog or pidgeon pose. 

### Core muscles of contraction 

- Masseter Muscle - Chewing muscle
- So as Muscle
- Diaphram
- Psoas & Iliacus Muscle
- Abductors


## Understanding the poly vagal theory and TRE
Words uses on the Freeze, Fight/Flight, Social Engagement graph are all based on the Polyvagal system. The up and down graph is from the Sympathetic / Parasympathetic System. 

Overall its learning the language of our Nervous system and noticing how our body behaves. 

### Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)

Sympathetic = Gas Pedal
Parasympathetic = Break Pedal

When both pedals are pushed we go into freeze modes of overwhelm. 

2 Names of the Green Area = Social Enggagement, Ventral Vargal

The word of Vargal origintes from the discussion of Vagus Nerve.

**Polygaval Theory** comes from the idea that as fish or primitive creations we only had the Blue / Freeze zone, as reptiles developed we also developed the Fight/Flight / Red zone. Finally as Mamals came about, so did the Social Engagement / Green Zone. 

**Vegus Nerve** runs all along the organis from the brain down as a superhighway of information from the organs to the brain and vice versa. 

It helps to:
- It regulates heat
- Reduces heart rate and blood pressure.
- Lowers heart rate 
- Regulates gastralintensinal operations.
- Neural regulator of the face muscles and other muscles which are under voluntary control. 

In addition to the above you can be in 2 zones at the same time. For example if your are being creative you can be in the green zone but draw from the blue zone where you are more out of body and creative. 

Blue and Red zones are not just negative but also a state of passion or arousal. For example blue zone is more about being in your head as well as potentially being negative. An example was many creative writers spend a lot of time in the Blue zone and use those experiences in the green zone to be social and expand on that experience to create good works of art. 

Fight, Flight and Freeze are Flooding States where we are more emotional (the 3 main phases are Freezing, Flooding and Dissacociation), the main flooding state is the overwhelm state at number 7 breaking into 8 being a high arousal state. Another experience once you hit 8+ is dissociation when we day dream or phase out of reality. Physical action is normally the best course of action to bring someone down from 8+. 

Questions for the afternoon
1. What sums up my experience in a word
2. Any questions I need answered before we leave this week
	1. Is there a video or guide sheet to reference for personal exploration 


## Developing My Practise 

No more than 3 times a week, ideally 1 day break between. 

Length of time is not important, more just about intentionality and noticing the experience and feeling it out. Ideally no more than 10-15min.

After practising 5-6 times try skipping to the wall excersises or the on the floor excersizes instead of going from the start with the feet excersizes. The excersizes are a large part about grounding from a higher state of 4+ and bringin it down to the Green Ventral Vargal state to then flow into a natural tremor state. 

Tremoring on the wall is totally possible too without needing to purely move to a liying down state.

If during tremoring you notice the state of activation, getting more into ego, fight or flight state its best to ground more.

Signs you are doing TRE too much are feeling more vunreble, tired all the time, more Irritated or emotional.
