## What Is an End of Day Report?

An end of day report is a form of record-keeping for projects in the organizations that details the events and activities in the workplace. It is usually prepared by an [employee](https://lumiformapp.com/lexicon/employee) and submitted to their supervisors.

Often referred to as an EOD report, it functions as a comprehensive work diary where workers write down not only their daily activities but also the achievements and challenges they have at work. At times, it also includes their plans for the following day.

A typical EOD report consists of two sections — the activity and the objective sections.

-   Activity Section - the activity section makes up most of the report. It includes insightful descriptions of all the activities done within the day. Some of this information includes details about the task, resources used, other chores, and challenges encountered.
-   Objective Section - it occupies only a small portion of the report. Yet, it is extremely vital because it highlights the employee’s goals and the methods he/she will use to accomplish them.



## What Should Be Included in an EOD Report?

Daily end of day reports allow project managers to monitor each of their team member’s efforts and group dynamics. It also serves as a metric of what has been accomplished, challenges faced, and improvements that are needed.  

It focuses on **three main points**:

1.  Achievements - the daily report should include positive milestones the team has accomplished each day. Since the main purpose of an end of day report is to provide updates, it should also include the progress that has been made for that particular day. Aside from monitoring daily activities and project completion, it can also become a source of motivation for the team.
2.  Plans for the next day - Since it is a monitoring tool, the team must be able to show what tasks need to be accomplished the next day. It will give the project manager time to prepare the resources needed and manpower available to finish the task. It will also show each team member if they are still on track or not.
3.  Challenges faced - problems and challenges the team faces when executing the task must also be included. It should also include the solution to that problem, so other team members are aware of what to do when facing a similar problem.

Other **best practices** to use to have an insightful end of day report are:

-   Make it simple Use easy-to-understand language so everyone can understand and no confusion can arise. Make sure that all activities are listed in a natural flow.
-   Be descriptive Maintain the whole report in a descriptive tone and try to answer each WH (what, who, when, where, and when) question.
-   Include dates By including date stamps, it will be easier to track everything and map your productivity.
-   Incorporate images Photographic evidence is the best way to show how procedures are done and the progress being made.
