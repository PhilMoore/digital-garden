# Cover Letter Inspiration

## **Let’s talk about me**
I’m a social media manager who loves the technology, science and well produced videos.


## **What I do**
I work for myself and a small company in the Netherlands known as Puqpress. I’m the Marketing Manager here which means that I present our team and products in their best light to our audience with quality content that is pretty and informative. I also capture, edit and caption this content. I think we do a pretty good job, our  [customers seem to think so, too](http://www.speaklight.com/case-studies) .

Puqpress is a great place to work. But I want more. I want to learn/,/improve and to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges. **The Verge is that next challenge…**


## **Let’s talk about you**
**You are the best**

You are The Verge. You create awesome engaging content while keeping nerdy readers like myself informed, and quite frankly make the  [web a better place](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/) .


## **You need the best**
You need a *rock star*. You need somebody who’s in-tune with all things tech and will do their best. This is a high-profile job at a company that is put on a pedestal by the tech community. But it’s not all fun and games — this is a tough challenge. This is a position that requires a *thick skin*, *amazing skills*, and *supernatural confidence*.


## **I’m that guy**
**I love a challenge!** I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. I look forward to making The Verge better by my addition. I want to learn, teach and I want to improve together with you!
