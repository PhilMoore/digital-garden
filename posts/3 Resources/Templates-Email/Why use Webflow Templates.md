# Why use Webflow Templates

Taken from Loud Sales Yoga client email:  
  
The most expensive of these templates is $80USD and if the client likes one of these (for example) we would speak with them to find out what design aspects they like from this theme, what they don't like, what they would want to change and if they liked any elements from the other 2 templates.

Overall with this exercise, we would get a much better understanding of the design style that the customer is envisioning for their website and would get us 50% of the way to getting the website built, we only need to generate the content, change the flow of the pages and maybe redesign a few sections and avoid having to create the Figma wireframe saving a big chunk of the budget.

Just more food for thought as this is generally the easiest way for most of our clients to get started with a website, especially as most of them don't really have much input in terms of what they want the website to look like until they receive the first draft.

Please note that these aren't your Squarespace/Wix or Shopify templates which are very fixed. Every one of these would be customised to the customer's unique business, branding and content, it just gives us a draft that we know the customer likes so speeds up the build and reduces the amount of time we spend on revisions.
