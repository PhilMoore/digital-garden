# Moore Design - Webflow Project Email Template

Hey XXX,

Thanks for getting in touch, it's been a minute!

We'd be more than happy to quote for a new website for you. For this new site as it's mostly an information site (no e-commerce), we would suggest using [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) as the platform.

Webflow is very affordably [priced](https://webflow.com/pricing) and is fully customisable unlike many other similar website builders (Squarespace, Wix, Shopify, etc), it's also incredibly fast, great for SEO and never requires updates or ongoing maintenance.

To start with I would suggest having a look at some of the [Webflow Themes](https://webflow.com/templates/tag/portfolio-websites). I've filtered the themes to only show Portfolio themes which seems to be in line with the kind of website I believe you wanted. If you don't find much on there that fits with what you wanted us to create I'd suggest looking at the main theme list [here.](https://webflow.com/templates)

Please note, every element, section etc is 100% customisable on these themes, nothing is locked in or can't be edited, we can even recreate elements from 2 themes you like if you're struggling to choose one.

The reason we generally prefer to start with a Theme is that they give us a good starting point for the basis of the website and allows you to help us get something close to what you wanted from the start without having to create a bunch of mock-ups or wireframes for you to choose from. This greatly speeds up the building process and reduced the cost even after factoring in the cost of the theme.

Before we can send the quote, I wanted to ask a few more questions to give us an idea of our responsibility so we can give you something pretty close to the final cost.

1.  Do you have the content for the pages we will be building, e.g. about me content, content for the home/landing page, partnerships and press? Or will you need some assistance from us to write this content? If so please send over what you currently have.
2.  Do you have any branding colours or logos for your personal brand already made or did you also need us to create this? If so do you have a preference on colours/branding (e.g. any other sites you like the branding off and want us to use for inspiration)?
3.  Do you have a collection of high-quality images we can use for the website? If so, can you create a folder on google drive/dropbox and send them to us?

Regarding the start time of the project, the earliest we can start is 2 weeks from now 25th of July and estimate a week or two tops to complete (depending on revisions). Let me know if this is ok for you.

Finally, once we have some answers from you on the above questions I'll be able to provide a quote.

Feel free to send over any themes you like the look of or any questions on ones you find that you like.

Have a great day!
