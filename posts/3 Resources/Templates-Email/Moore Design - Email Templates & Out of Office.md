Holiday Notification

Hi [client],

I just wanted to let you know that I will be away on holiday from Monday, June 17th to 28th, and will be available to work from Monday 1st July.

I will be contactable via email, although I can not guarantee that I will respond quickly.

If you have any small or non-urgent tasks, I may be able to make a little time while I am away so please keep in contact and I will do my best to help.
