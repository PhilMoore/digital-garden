# New Client - Shopify Theme Templates Email

If you want to have a look Shopify has a nice collection of themes at various prices: [https://themes.shopify.com/themes/](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/)

I can also offer to install some of the themes I already own for your new store however my theme collection is a little limited.

Here's what I have to offer:

-   [Prestige](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/prestige/styles/couture/preview)
-   [Empire](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/empire/styles/graphic/preview?architecture%5B%5D=os2&surface_detail=empire&surface_inter_position=1&surface_intra_position=1&surface_type=search)
-   [Broadcast](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/broadcast/styles/bold/preview)
-   [Impulse](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/impulse/styles/modern/preview)

Please note, if we go down the route of having me install one of these themes and customise it, you will not be able to receive theme updates from Shopify and the features, version etc will always remain the same.

Generally, theme updates include bug fixes, feature updates and improvements as well as new sections so it is worth purchasing one if there's a specific theme which catches your eye.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
