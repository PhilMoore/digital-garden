# Holgro UX & Design Review

## Menus
Left hand menu needs to start open as default as its not clear what this stuff does, otherwise maybe having a modal tutorial added to the site for the first time the user logs in, shows them around and what it does.


## Dashboard
Welcome to HOLGRO section takes up a lot of space and there’s no way to remove it before you can scroll to the main dashboard section. So maybe make this a collapsible/modal that can be dismissed or hidden.

Also we could possibly condense the Welcome to HOLGRO section with a 2 column look showing the video on one side and the text on another.

Dashboard content is not very useful at the moment or enageging for new users, they probably aren’t very interested in seeing the newest members. Demo site has this a lot better.


## My Profile
This area looks more like a dashboard than the actual dashboard.

Profile page seems more personal and interesting as a dashboard for users than what currently exists.

This page is good but it needs an “edit my profile” link or button to appear for the user logged in. It’s not clear that to change information you need to click on your avatar and this is purely just public information in a page.

UX idea for user pages is to change the headings to “My Info”, My Activity” etc as these headings are the same when you are visiting another users profile so its not clear if clicking them will show your activity or theirs. This might be a limitation of the app but worth looking into.

Also the right hand menu bar with icons and profile (where the avatar picture is) seems to either duplicate sections e.g:

Friends is duplicated, message need to be next to friends and more, if this is a feature people will use often.

Notifications has a globe icon which does not translate to notifications, the icon for this is commonly a bell , this is also quite hidden and might benefit from being in the profile menu too like Friends and more.

Reviews can be placed in the more dropdown as this is not that common of an interaction for the social network side. Same with My friends, this is not something people often interact with so its better off in the More menu.

Overview is empty, this should be removed?

Is activty only the users activity or all activity e.g. the feed? This also seems to be the main way to get the social media feed side of the site which might be better off on the homepage/main dashboard and condense all other dashboard sections to the side, inviting the user to engage as well as review their info/tasks/goals etc.


## Other Users Profiles

We’d suggest moving the unfriend button away from the message button or vice versa. Its pretty easy for you to mistakenly unfriend someone.

Also maybe change the colours of the two buttons too.


## My Courses
90% of the content shown on the My Courses page is not relevant to courses. E.g. all the profile info Activity, overwiew, reviews and the profile section above.

The dashboard has more information on the course status than the My Courses page.

I suggest rethinking this page (if possible) to focus purely on courses.


## Book a Mentoring Session
This page is much clearer and easier to understand.

Form ideally need a dropdown or tick boxes for the user to select what area or areas they need help with as well as keeping the description box for them to write more info.

Width wise I would say this page needs condensing too as it feels too big for its purpose.


## My Community
Groups need to also display here, its only showing friends and friend requests.  
Forums should also be here if that’s a feature.

It’s also confusing that the left menu mentions “my community” and the top menu mentions community.

For the left menu it might be worth changing this to My People or My Friends & Groups etc. I feel this is a bit clearer.

There are also additional My community links which can only be seen when the left menu is expanded. Clicking My Community takes you to the friends page, but also clicking My Friends takes you to the friends page.

We’d suggest changing the My community link to take you to the main social media activity feed showing all posts from your friends and groups.


# Memberships
This page needs to be totally redesigned a landing page / sales page that explains all of the features better and uses good copy to sell the user on signing up. The current table implementation would be great at the end but overall it needs more of a sales / design element to the page to explain and sell you on signing up.


# Academy
The main cover image is not very useful or necessary in these pages, It might be better to have a tiled or textured background image across those whole page and condense the main cover Heading image to a bar around the same size as the top HOLGRO menu bar. .

Also remove the breadcrumbs link element or add it to the new style heading bar idea I mentioned above all in the same width so it takes up less space and its clearer that’s its a link and not a sub heading.


## Courses
Needs to be more obvious this is actually a course. Easy enough to understand when your in courses but you can stumble across these during the blog section of the academy and just having a tag in the same colour as the others makes it hard to notice.

I suggest for now either starting the title with COURSE: might work but otherwise we need a better way of making these more eye catching or interesting.

There’s also no way to sign up to the course on the Course blog post view or at least its not obvious at all.

There’s no way to unregister from the course on the course’s page either.

On the actual course module page there are 3 buttons in view (at certain places) all showing “Mark Complete”. Might be worth removing some of them or at least the orange complete activity button as this does not feel necessary.

P.S. Courses content type is duplicated on this one.

It is not very clear what these boxes (in circles do) might be worth just removing them or expanding on them in a different view style, e.g. a list instead of icons.

Overall I’d say this page has content that is too big. It does not feel like a community hub. It might be better to change this page to more of a community landing page which provides community dashboard information, e.g. events, forums, groups, marketplace and invites you to explore these more.

I woulld also consider changing the users to be smaller, there’s currently 28 and that leads to 2 pages. This should ideally be viewable in one page as once there’s a few hundred users this will be very tedious to browse through.


## Partners
The overall design of the partner bios needs re thinking, text feels too big too long for most people.

Bio should focus more on specialities and credentials and less on the actual bio text. This really needs to be 4 lines maximum and then has a link to read more in their profile bio. Currently there’s too much text and it makes this page have a bad design, especially without any specialties or credentials even added to these partners.

View profile is good, but it would also be nice to have a link to message them directly instead of having to go through the profile first.


## Groups

page header title / description hasnt been set!!

Course section in Groups seems broken or not functioning correctly (see white spaces below):

Add a link under “Group RSS” explaining what this is and how to use it, 99% of users will not understand this. Also design wise the RSS feed is the most CTA element on this page. It’s also showing up in 2 locations. The one in the screenshot below does not seem necessary and also this box takes up a lot of premium space on this page.

# Marketplace
Tradesquare logo is too big and in your face. This might be a better page to build out as a landing page or just a quick redesign.


## FAQ
Content here is placeholder and includes Loren ipsum text. Might be better to disable this page until its done.


## About us
This page really needs to be the membership page, it says very little about HOLGRO itself and more about the membership features.

About us needs to be more about you and HOLGRO and less of a sales page. This content is better placed on the Membership page.

The only relevant elements of the about us page are the HOLGRO Values & Our Purpose, Our Mission section.

This is the only place you see this type of layout (screenshots below) on the site. The layout is nice so might be worth using in other areas like the Partners page or other pages.

# Contact
This page has a nice design, we should do this same style of design for the form to other forms. Only problem is it currently takes up a lot of space for what it is & could be condensed.

Otherwise submit button needs better colours.
