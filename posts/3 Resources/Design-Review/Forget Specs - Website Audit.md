# Forget Specs Website Audit

## Current Website:

[https://www.forgetspecs.com/](https://www.forgetspecs.com/)

### Current Platform:

Squarespace

### Site Requirements:
-   High volume international traffic & sales
-   Flawless sales proccess


## Platform
Reccomend switching to shopify - It's great for your needs and has much better functionality and options vs squarespace.  
Ability to set up custom shipping profiles for different countries, regions, states as well as exclude locations all together.  
Also options to calculate shipping rates with courier/logistics partners.

Great analytics built so you can track your sales data.


## Design
Use of one only colour makes the whole site feel very much the same. This also doesn't allow your primary brand colour to pop and draw attention. Adding more colours or shades will allow you to add contrast, depth and envoke emotion & to give cues to user for CTA (call to action) areas and buttons.

Very simple which can be great but is lacking in personality to tell a story and connect with customer on a personal level vs only connecting on the funtional benefits of the product.

Device rendering is not great - this can be adjusted depending on the platforms options for responsive design.

Inline styles & Javascript here will be down to the platform & theme, unless you have custom coded anything - there could be issues there.


## SEO

Keywords, phrases, use in headings & meta descriptions can all be improved, Would suggest keyword research and planning of these to increase SEO and conversions.

Paying attention to Heading tags is important for seo ranking. (multiple H1 tags on 1 page)

Improving the low text content would also help with searchability and having a meaningful user engagement.


## Speed
Pagespeed index ranking seems low, however it can be difficult to resolve these especially when using most web platforms.  
I would say this is a pretty average score which you would get on most e-commerce platforms, especially with tracking codes such as google, facebook, etc being added. These all impact the score and can be incredibly difficult to reduce a score because of these factors. Even googles own tracking code results in errors and lowers the score!  
You can see from the pagespeed insight report that 2 of the biggest load blockers are squarespace and youtube (of which I don't even see any videos - but the code is still being loaded regardless).  
  
The main part you can control would be choosing a well built theme on your chosen platform, and ensuring image formats and sizes are correct. Trying to have text before images at the top of your page will give you a better score but not nessecarily a better website as a whole!

## Integartions
List of intergrations found on your site

Most of these will be tracking codes or intergrations from squarespace wether you know what they are/use them or not
