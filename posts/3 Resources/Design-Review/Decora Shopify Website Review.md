**Notes:** The google speed test is only a general indicator of site speed and performance and achieving and 100 score is almost impossible but this gives us a good understanding of what is working and what needs further attention.

Unfortunately Shopify is limited in being able to action all of the optimisations it requests but we can do what we can do bring this up higher.

Based on the shopify analytics over the last year vs the previous year, I can see that your customers are primarily using their mobile devices to view your site which is something to consider with regards to the Shopify theme you are using and optimising the shopping process for those customers. Currently you’re theme is optimised more for desktop (based on the speed scores, general testing and the conversion rates).

If you are interested, your conversion rates over the last year by device are as follows:

### Apps
Another thing to consider for speed and code optimisation is the apps you use on your site. From our website review we count 23 apps listed as follows:
-   AdRoll
-   AfterShip Order Tracking
-   Bulk Product Edit
-   CloudSearch
-   Facebook
-   Frequently Bought Together
-   Google
-   Infinite Options by ShopPad
-   InkFrog Open
-   Judge.me Product Reviews
-   Last-Step Cross-Sell Offers
-   LeadDyno Affiliate Marketing
-   Lucky Orange
-   Mailchimp
-   Order Printer
-   Order Printer Pro
-   Pinterest
-   Privy - Pop Ups, Email & SMS
-   Product Reviews
-   ShopSync
-   Stock Inventory Management
-   Tawk.to Live Chat
-   Vimeo Create - Video Maker

This is quite a long list and defiantly larger than the average store. I would strongly consider reviewing this list and removing any apps that you do not currently use or need. This could partially save you some money per month on subscriptions as some of theses apps are paid, but the bigger gain would be to remove excess unneeded code and speed up your site.

You can read more on how Shopify apps effect your stores speed below (if you’re interested, its not necessary).

## Shopify Theme
Your shopify theme is one of the biggest and easiest things to change with regards to improving and optimising the store.

I have reached out to Sebastian on the name of the current theme you are using as I believe it was installed by him or his team. Once I receive a response from him on this I’ll be able to offer additional options depending on the theme and its documentation as well as seeing if theres a newer version of the theme.

Based on what I see on the backend of shopify the theme name is “20191007 BT Custom 2.1 - No Paypal” which leads me to believe that it is a customised version of a theme that he is using and in terms of code it probably hasn’t been updated since 2019.

I will communicate with Sebastian around this and let you know my findings and provide further options based on his response.


## Code Review
Inspecting the code has revealed that there are some errors on the site that need fixing.

I also wanted to let you know that the following are broken or need attention.

-   Track my order link on menu is broken
-   Most email and phone links on the site are not linking and are displayed as text.
-   The search button on your footer works, however it links to a page where the search app you are using takes over and leads to a busy/confusing user experience:

-   Missing images or broken links and formatting issues on the collection pages:

These can all be fixed and I would also consider using an application like the one linked below to scale your product images to be the same aspect ratio (square, portrait etc):

[Bulk Image Edit ‑ Image SEO – Ecommerce Plugins for Online Stores – Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/bulk-image-edit)

This would help the look and feel of the site and also scale any large images down to a web-safe size for improving product page loading speeds.

I don't want to go too deep on the code front at the moment as any big picture changes like a new version of your theme or a different theme all together will improve the code without us having to spend hours optimising the current theme.


## Conclusion
Overall the site is In a good place, however it definitely needs some optimisation and speed / design fixes in order for it to stay competitive in 2021.

Customers are becoming more critical when shopping online on smaller retailers vs Amazon which they know is generally safe and fast. This makes it incredibly important in our eyes to ensure your site is fast, responsive and fully working to avoid losing customers and improve your conversion rates.

Based on what Sebastians response will be on the theme used on your site I’d suggest one of the following options.

1.  Update the theme to a new version and re-create any theme customisations and design.
2.  Switch to a new similar theme that is faster on mobile and also results in a great desktop experience.
3.  Update and fix the current theme.

**Option 1:** This could be a great option if there is a suitable and updated version of your current theme that is faster and solves many of the page-speed issues that google has raised.

This option is generally preferred over option 3 as will save us many hours of testing if speed is a priority. It could also yield some additional improvements and features to your theme as well as updates to new web standards that have been released over the last few years.

**Option 2:** This is one of the easier options if option 1 is not possible or straight forward. There are many great themes available for shopify that have a similar look and style as yours but perform much better.

These are two great theme developers that we have used in the past that we would recommend:

[Shopify Themes](https://outofthesandbox.com/collections/themes)

[Shopify Themes - Premium Ecommerce Templates - Pixel Union](https://pixelunion.net/collections/shopify-themes)

One theme that stands to mind and looks quite similar is this:

[Empire](https://pixelunion.net/products/empire)

**Option 3:** This option would be suitable if you only want us to make minor changes or fixes to the site. Any big code changes or speed improvements would need a lot of testing and might result in a larger expense for you vs something like option 2 with a theme like Empire or some other themes + our time to copy over your theme customisations and styling.
