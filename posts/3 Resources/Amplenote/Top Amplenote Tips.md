One of the most efficient methods to move between notes is with the [Quick Open dialog](https://www.amplenote.com/help/organizing_notes_quick_search#). To launch it on desktop type `ctrl`+`o` (on Mac: `**‚åò**`+`o`) or click the right-hand icon in the search field. On mobile Quick Open is the default view when clicking the Search icon in the header.

The Quick Open lists the notes that were opened most recently and you can search and filter for specific notes. Selecting a note will remember your most recent cursor position so you can continue working without interruption.

Index and connect information by linking to other notes. Each note's Backlinks tab will list all links pointing to that note. In the same tab you can discover connections by searching for unlinked instances of the note name.

Update and rearrange tasks without breaking your flow. In Amplenote you can access a [list of task commands](https://www.amplenote.com/help/task_commands_menu#) by entering `!` at the beginning of a task, or mid-line after a space.

View only on the relevant tasks at hand by creating calendar Task Domains to divide your to-do list between Work, Personal, and any other areas of focus. With separate source notes, each Task Domain can be synced with different Google and Outlook calendars to import events and publish tasks in that domain.

Get started using the calendar by [setting up your Task Domains](https://www.amplenote.com/help/using_calendar_task_domains#).

Tasks offer an array of properties you can use to help your future self separate the wheat from the chaff. When you set a task as ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù or fast, we use that detail to help you schedule the task on your calendar sooner than later.
