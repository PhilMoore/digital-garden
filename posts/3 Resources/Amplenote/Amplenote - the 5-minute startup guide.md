# Amplenote - the 5-minute startup guide

Welcome to Amplenote, we're glad you're here!

This note outlines how Amplenote can help you maximize efficiency and focus on what's important. The four modes accessed at the top of the sidebar support each stage of the idea execution funnel, allowing you to bring your best ideas to life.

If you have an existing library of notes in a different app the quickest way to get started is by importing your notes from [Evernote](https://www.amplenote.com/help/import_from_evernote_how_to#How_do_I_import_from_Evernote?), [Roam](https://www.amplenote.com/help/import_from_roam#), or markdown files.

Once you're up and running you can access your notes anywhere with offline support on unlimited devices:

Jots allow you to quickly capture ideas and information with minimal distractions. A new jot is created each day, ready for you to log activity or inspiration. You can work in the the default `#daily-jots` tag or select a different tag from the sidebar to create daily notes for specific topics.

Move to Notes mode when you are ready to edit, organize, and publish content. This is where you can refine content, view completed tasks, and view backlinks to related notes. You can also add collaborators to notes and secure you notes with Vault encryption (Pro+ feature).

While every task lives in a note, Task mode allows you to view open tasks from all notes and surface the top priorities. Task details can be expanded to adjust the importance, change the task recurrence, or hide the task until later.

See some ways that we use Tasks mode in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6NqWJWgYyw).

In the Calendar mode you can build out your schedule with maximum ease and efficiency. Set up different task domains to pull content from separate source notes and external calendars. Unscheduled tasks from the domain's source notes are listed in the sidebar, ready to be scheduled.
