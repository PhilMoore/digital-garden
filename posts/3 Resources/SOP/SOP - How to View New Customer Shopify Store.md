First, select **Online Store** under Sales channels then click **Themes**


### Step 5: Select & preview the new theme

Most of the time (if it's an existing/established store) this new theme will be in the lower section of the themes page under **Theme Library**.

In the case of this example, it's the topmost theme in Theme Library, however, this is not always the case. _The top theme is generally the most recently updated one._

Next, click on the **Actions** drop-down and select **Preview**.

### Step 6 (Optional): Share the link to the theme preview with someone who does not have access to the store.

Once you are previewing the new theme, look for the Green **Share Preview** button on the bottom right of the page:

Click this button and copy the share link.

ðŸ’¡ **Please Note:** Anyone with this link can access the preview within the next 2 days. After this time the link will expire and you will need to generate a new link.
