In the top right of the page you’ll see a “Search contacts” box, paste the customers email address there or search for them by name.

## Step 2A: Adding A customer

If you can’t find the customer by searching for their name, click the blue “Add a contact” button and fill out their details.

After you have done this, press the skip button in the following screen:

Once you have done this, repeat step 2 above and then continue to step 3.

## Step 3: Click The Customer

If you have searched for the customer by name you’ll need to complete this step. Otherwise if you just entered the email address directly you can continue with step 4.

## Step 4: Tagging The Customer

Next up all you need to do is click on the “Tags” box and enter the relevant tag.

In this case we are adding the “Attended Call” tag as this customer was present during our sales call.

THATS IT!

Now the customer is tagged and the sales follow up automation will begin automatically.
