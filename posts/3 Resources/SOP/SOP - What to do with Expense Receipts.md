# SOP - What to do with Expense Receipts

In this document, we’ll cover what to do with the expense receipts you have so they are processed by our accounts team.  


## Step 0: (For physical receipts) scan or take a picture of the receipt
If you’ve been handed a physical receipt which needs adding to our expenses the first time is to take a picture of the receipt or scan it using a document scanner or app.

  
If you would like to scan it using an iPhone you can use [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210336).

On Android? Use [this guide.](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-scan-documents-android/)

  
Otherwise, a plain old picture will do if it's not blurry.


## Step 1: Send it to Accounts
Below we’ll go into options for each format.


### Step 1A: Emailed Receipts/Invoices
If you were emailed a receipt with an attached receipt/invoice All you need to do is forward the email with the attachment or link to the receipt to [accounts@caliperglobal.com](https://mailto:accounts@caliperglobal.com)


### Step 1B: Scanned or Picture Receipts
If you followed **Step 0** above you’ll have a receipt somewhere on your phone or laptop that you need to send. There are a number of ways to do this so I’ll go over some common options below.

**Option 1:** Open your email client, create a new email to [accounts@caliperglobal.com](https://mailto:accounts@caliperglobal.com) then attach the picture or document and send.

**Option 2:** Select the picture/file in the app you used to scan or snap the picture and use the share sheet on iOS or Android and select your email client. This should automatically open your email client, create an email and attach the receipt. All you need to do now is add [accounts@caliperglobal.com](https://mailto:accounts@caliperglobal.com) as the email address and send.  

If you don't know what the share sheet is it looks like this on iOS:

## That's it, you're done!

There’s no step 2 in this process yet. Once you’ve completed the steps above, you're good to go. Accounts@ will email you back if they have any questions regarding the receipt.
