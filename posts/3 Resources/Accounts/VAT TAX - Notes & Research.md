### Filing Yearly / Quarterly / Monthly
https://www.xero.com/uk/guides/choosing-a-vat-accounting-scheme/

**Benefits of Filing Monthly**
- For an export company without much VAT to pay, filing monthly could be better as you will be claiming more often from HRMC thus recouping costs for cashflow. 
- If your business receives regular VAT rebates, and you rely on these rebates to keep trading, then moving to monthly VAT can be a great way to help your cash-flow situation.
- If you want to spread the impact of your VAT payments by going monthly, the annual accounting scheme will do this for you.

**Benefits of filing Quarterly**
If you’re a business that has a lot of VAT to claim on purchases and expenses, the annual accounting scheme won’t work for you.

You only get to claim back your VAT when you file your return at the end of the year. Because you only get your VAT back once a year, this would be bad for cash flow and you’ll be better off with quarterly periods.

Once you’re VATable turnover is over £1.6m, you have to come off the annual scheme.




##  The 3 main VAT schemes

### Flat rate scheme
If your business’s annual turnover is £150,000 or less, you can pay a fixed rate of VAT to HMRC which is a percentage of your total sales. This scheme is designed to be simpler for businesses with a smaller turnover. 

There are different rates for different trades – your accountant will be able to advise on what your rate will be and whether this scheme will save your business money.

Under this scheme, you simply pay a percentage of your total turnover as VAT. The actual amount you pay depends on the type of business you run – [different industries have different flat VAT rates](https://www.gov.uk/vat-flat-rate-scheme/how-much-you-pay). You must also consider if your business would be classed as a ‘limited cost business’ when looking at which percentage of VAT you would pay to HMRC.

You'll still have to charge VAT on your invoices, but you don't have to account for the VAT details of every purchase made. Only smaller businesses, with annual turnover up to £150,000, can use this VAT scheme. Check with HMRC to find out whether yours is eligible.

  
### Cash accounting - Annual Scheme
If your annual turnover is less than £1.35m, you can use cash accounting for VAT purposes. Unlike standard VAT accounting, with cash accounting you don’t count invoices issued when calculating VAT, but rather actual income and expenditure. This can be helpful with cash flow if you expect to be paid in instalments, for example.

With this scheme, you account for your VAT in 12 monthly instalments across the year and then make one VAT return at the end of the year. Once you complete the VAT return, you start making quarterly interim payments for the VAT you estimate that you’ll owe. This method allows you to budget more carefully and because payments are spread throughout the year, it’s often better for cash flow. However, you may end up over-paying or under-paying HMRC at times, so you may be required to make a final balance payment or apply for a refund

-   You make advance payments towards your VAT bill, with the amount being based on your last return (or an estimated amount if you’re new to VAT)
-   When you submit your annual return, you then either make a final payment, or apply for a refund – all depending on the difference between your advance payments and your actual VAT bill.

With cash accounting, you account for VAT on the date you’re paid as opposed to the date you send the invoice. This can be especially helpful if you have slow payers, since you won't have to pay VAT before you’ve been paid. This option isn’t well suited to businesses that buy a lot of items on credit.


### Standard VAT - Quarterly Scheme
With this scheme you charge 20% VAT and calculate whether the VAT they have charged during each quarter is higher than the VAT that has been paid for business purposes. You will then need to pay the difference quarterly to HMRC (or receive a VAT refund). Your QAccounting professional will help you keep track of every purchase and sale, to make calculating your quarterly return a simple process.

## **When is VAT due?**

When your company’s VAT returns are due depends on when the business first became registered for VAT. Your VAT return and any VAT due must be submitted 1 month and 7 days after the end of the accounting period – whether quarterly or monthly.
