# Stripe Info & Tips

Stripe Fees = Tax Inclusive

Best way to reconcile stripe is: 

Navigate to **Payments > All Transactions** then export the list to a spreadsheet and filter by **Available On (UTC)** date. Add this to a spreadsheet and go through dates and cross out what is done. 

Finally Review the balance at the start/end of the month via **Reports > Financial Reports** 

> [!NOTE] ACCOUNTANT TIP
> Use the "Created on Date" for less crossover with bill dates.
