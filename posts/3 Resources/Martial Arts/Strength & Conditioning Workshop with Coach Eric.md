# Strength
Why even work on strength? You're not weightlifters, right? You almost step into the ring. There's no barbell waiting for any type of resistance.

You can pick up 100 kilos slow, but there's no way you're gonna pick it up fast. So this kind of leads to that power can involve strength. So if you're not strong, you can't be powerful. By definition, you can't be powerful if you're not strong. Because power is mass times distance over time.

So sitting there doing heavy reps is not what you're after. You guys aren't bodybuilders. There's other there's a place for a little bodybuilding, but the bulk of your strength work is going to be with a bar. So think squat, deadlift, bench press rows, you want all of this good stuff. And aside from being able to fight better, it's going to help you prevent injuries. Because one of the things that grow tendons is tension. So if you've got Max tension on a muscle group, then those tenants are actually being made stronger by this lifting.

You also need to break out weak legs, because we've all got weak legs right? When you do a takedown if your hamstrings are the weak link you're not going to be as good as an opponent that throws a punch, you won't be able to absorb the force of the punch. If your shoulders and your triceps aren't strong, right?

And so you're missing out on knockout power and lastly, you need to address the imbalances.

By definition athletes are imbalanced. That's what makes them good at what they do. However, if the imbalance gets too big, that injury starts to happen. Because we've all seen the boxers hunched over. And the problem is if this gets too extreme, then now their backs are so weak that they can’t manage their shoulders and start getting shoulder injuries so it's important to address the backside of the body on strikers.

Now you're probably thinking “How do you even do all this?” Like what does this even look like?

So it's all those big lists that I mentioned, squat bench deadlift, but you want to go low rep. Which means you're doing sets of three to five, right? Not 12, this is not Mr Olympia and you're doing low sets to you're doing three to five sets and you're gonna rest a long time. All times like two minutes. So for your rest periods, for about two minutes, shadowbox. Footwork Drills you can stretch a little bit to keep it light and want the blood still flowing but you don't want to be doing conditioning and strength and conditioning, conditioning and conditioning.

As far as the weight goes up. How heavy is heavy? Heavy is anything about 85% of your one rep max. one rep max just means the heaviest thing you can lift one time without fumbling over. And we want to save you from about 85% So we're talking 85-95, if you go much above 95% your form starts to get worse and that's not going to help.

With fighters. You don't want to go Max Max Max. It should be tough like a ball buster. But you should get you shouldn't get to the point you fail a rep.

How many times a week should you do this? How long should these sessions be? If you are seriously training you should be doing this twice a week. And if you've got a fight in Excel or a camp, you drop it to once a week, because you're not gonna get much stronger in a couple of weeks.

So that's the strength for this is the strongest part of the three-week injury prevention. You're gonna do stuff in like the 10 to 20 rep range, you're going to target the muscle, you're going to go for the top. And I know you're probably thinking but we don't want to get big and bulky. We don't want to get slow. You're not just gonna go hard on bodybuilding. You're gonna pick the things that you know are weak for almost everyone like hamstrings. Most everyone needs hamstring muscles. Almost everybody needs the back of your shoulder. So, rear delts this stuff, a lot of traps.

If you find that when you punch. You're kinda you're not able to really stick it, the triceps are probably going to be your friends. If you're down and you keep getting pushed down and can't drive through, your lower back needs work. So things like Good Mornings will be your friends here, as are deadlifts.

# Conditioning

## Aerobic Capacity
Strength is important because it's nice to be able to produce knockout forces. But it's not nice to only do that once. You need to deal with that over and over and over because you don't know if you're gonna get that nice clean yet in the third round and the fifth round. You need to be able to do it throughout the match. And on top of that, you need to be able to recover between fights unds between bites if you're in a tournament. And recovery is a big part of the issue. So there are a couple of ways to skin this cat.

So let's break conditioning down. There are basically two parts to aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic just means that you're using oxygen. Anaerobic means no oxygen. Aerobic is lower intensity, anaerobic is higher intensity**.** Makes sense. Because if you can't produce it with oxygen because it's too slow, you have to switch to burning sugar instead. So we'll start there are four things basically there's two for aerobic. The first aerobic is called aerobic capacity. This just means how long can you go.

For aerobic capacity, you're going to do a lot of road work jogging, cycling or running. So when you're working on aerobic capacity (which is all about training your heart), you're making your heartbeat at about 150 beats a minute. You're gonna keep it there for 30 to 90 minutes. So the longer you have before your flight, the more towards the 90-minute end. The shorter your flight is the closer to 30min you want to go. The important thing here is 30-90 minutes at zone 2 and that's it. It doesn't matter how you do it e.g. cycling, running, swimming, rowing. It's all about your heartbeat because the heart is stupid. It only knows if it needs to bear faster or slower. It doesn't know why. The reason you need this is not going to be just running around the cage.


### Vo2 Max Training
If you don't know what Vo2 Max is, it's the volume of oxygen you can carry your muscles or basically how much oxygen your muscles can use. because in order to actually make things happen you need oxygen. So the reason you do this is twofold. One is it actually makes your heart bigger. So that every time it squeezes up pumps blood or blood that's got oxygen out to the rest of your body. Because instead of your heart pumping really fast, if it's bigger it can go a bit slower. The other thing about this is that this is what gets you recovered faster. So this is the thing that when the round ends and you're on the bench for a minute, this is what brings you down again so that you can go fight fresher if you're not doing this then your ability to recover in between rounds is now compromised. And then towards the third or fourth round, you're gonna start feeling like dogshit.

The second reason that this is important is that this is what lets you do the anaerobic stuff because when you do the anaerobic stuff, you've got a bunch of waste products building and then if those build too high. By training vo2 max you're helping your ability to clear out the waste and keep operating at a high density.

You can do this every day, but you should train this one to three times a week. I've had great success with 45 minutes apart for each set. So twice a week. 45 minutes has done me just fine. Everyone's a little bit different. And also again, it depends on your fight. If you got a three-round fight for 40 minutes you'll have to kind of pay attention and see how it's working for you. If you find that you're doing 40 minutes twice a week, and between rounds, you're like you know I'm ready to go. You’re good!


## Aerobic Power
Power is your engine. So for aerobic power, it's how much force can you produce while still staying aerobic while still being in that kind of comfy zone. This is how you can keep meeting all that nice hard-hitting happen, even after you've been just going back and forth.

To train aerobic power means going hard for 60 to 120 seconds and then the rest up till your heart rate it's 130bpm. That way You are fresh so that you can then go nice and hard again round after round. If you’re not as rested you're basically just wasting energy because you're not going as hard as you could.

A lot of it has to do with how muscles use oxygen and just training to be able to fight at high intensity. How can you do this? For training capacity, you're on treadmills, you're on exercise bikes, you're on rowers going hard for 60-120 seconds. You can ask to do pad work, hit heavy bags etc. For grapplers you want to do strongman stuff in particular flipping tires, pulling sledges lifting stones. This is great for this kind of work. Because you can hammer it and not hurt your body. So that's your aerobic system.


## Anaerobic Capacity
Now let's go anaerobic, what this means is that you can operate at a higher percentage, higher intensity for longer so you can give your all going for the submission, all that good stuff. You're producing that really high force for a longer amount of time. This is the stuff that really really sucks. Right in the sense that your lungs are gonna burn your muscles are gonna burn and you're gonna want to throw up.

You're going to try to combat this one is slightly different to training aerobic in the sense that you don't rest as long. You're only getting one to two minutes of rest. With aerobic power, you're getting full recovery, right? You're getting down to 130 beats. This you just get one to two minutes and you're at it again. You don't get all the nice reps. That's because we want to let the waste products build so we get used to having them so your body learns to deal with them and adapts to getting rid of them faster,

Training this means higher force workouts for 90 to 120 seconds. So it's about a half, two minutes. You get the rest of one to two minutes in between rounds. And you can set this up kind of like a fight, e.g. have three rounds and then the rest for five minutes and then you have another fight right so you can think of it as having three flights and then each one's got three rounds. Then rest up for two minutes.

You also want to start putting this in closer to the competition. The general rule is the capacity stuff comes earlier. The power stuff comes later because you want your gas tank nice and big. And then getting into how to effectively use your gas tank. For this type of training, you want to do this once to twice a week. So say your fights in three months. So for the first month, you do you can do only capacity. The second month is 50/50 and in the third month, you do only power. So that means you can have a nice smooth transition and you still get to keep that capacity.


## Anaerobic Power
For training Anaerobic Power, the good news is it's only 40 to 60 seconds. The bad news is it's like the shittiest 40-60 seconds of your life. The other good news is you wait until you get down to 130 beats. So you're not going to be totally destroyed. The anaerobic capacity stuff really destroys it. Like you're done for the day after that. The anaerobic power is not as much right because you get to fully rest in between for exactly the same reason that you fully grasp the error stuff, right? You want to have that nice high power output. You don't want to be punching weaker than you can. Because if you're beyond being rested (at 130bpm) you’re training yourself to do less than your optimal power. Again, train this once to twice per week. So it's 40-60 min rounds, six to 10 of those rounds. And then you wait until your heart is at 130. If it takes you 30 seconds to get to 130 (which it might do the first round or two) that's fine. It's all about being fresh. So you can go as hard as you can in those 40 to 60 seconds. And whether that be pad work, bag work etc and you want to keep it more specific, you don't wanna be doing calf raises. You want to be using the stuff that you would use in a fight. It's gonna be a lot of glutes & hamstrings for takedowns and kicks. It's gonna be a lot of triceps and shoulders for things like punches and elbows.

# Food & Nutrition
So that's conditioning. I know it's a hell of a lot. Now we can go on to the food part. We're gonna start out with energy balance, which is a fancy way to say how many calories you're putting in your face every day.

This is important because are you trying to stay in a weight loss? Are you trying to cut Are you trying to go up? What's happening? You can think of it as money. I got my bank account. And if I put in more money every day then I take out what happens to my bank account. It gets better. If I pull out more money than I put it what happens? It's that simple.

You need to make sure you're getting enough. Whatever that means. Whether it's enough to get to the weight class, whether it's enough to stay right where you are. If you're going up, try to go up about half a kilo a week. The reason is if you do you might think that one more is better, right? Why why do that when I can go up by two kilos, or go down by two kilos. The issue is that your body is this is the part where your body is smart. So if you're eating too little food, your body's gonna get most of it from fat. But if you're eating way too little. Your body's gonna start breaking down muscles for energy, and then you're not going to be leaner. You're just going to be a smaller version of what you already are. The point of cutting is usually to drop fat and keep muscle not just be tight. Because that's, that's deadweight but it doesn't do anything. It's just a backpack that just sits on your back. Muscle actually does things so you want to keep it and then on the other side, we'll why not just eat enough to go two kilos a week. As long as that problem is there's a cap on how much muscle you can build in a given point. Unless you're on drugs.


## Inflammation
All right. So for you guys, your biggest source of inflammation probably going to be working out, which is there's about there are two kinds of information, right? There's acute and there's chronic. What you guys doing here causes acute inflammation. So you have a tough workout, and your muscles are swollen. Just usually your muscles, maybe a little joint, and then within a day or two, it's gone. Chronic inflammation is because it's usually it's because you're fat. Really, that's one of the biggest correlations between obesity and inflammation, obesity drops and then people tend to be less inflamed. Another one is, if you're not sleeping, that's another one that kind of drives it up. Because what you're basically telling your body is wearing braces voting against students or us being super stressed. Also, inflammation goes up. Again, this is chronic inflammation. Acute is fine. It's fine. You actually want it because what that is, that's healing inflammation. It's healing. Its blood going through a thing. To deliver nutrients to take out waste products, and to kill bacteria, or pathogens.


## Supplements
Here's the biggest thing about someone to remember their supplemental. If your sleep sucks, if your nutrition sucks, and your training sucks, creatine is not going to fix it.If you're doing all that other stuff right? Then yeah, go ahead, start supplementing. Here's the thing about it though. As far as supplements go, there are really only three that I would ever recommend. Because they're the ones that actually really work. Number one is caffeine

Caffeine works, just don't consume it too close to bedtime. How much? You can go up to five cups a day which is about 500 milligrams of caffeine before you start having any kind of problems.

The second one is creatine…

The last one is, that you could call it a supplement, but whey protein with the protein or egg protein doesn't matter. It's just protein. It works.

# Sleep
All the cryo of therapy, all the massage guns, all the active release techniques. None of that's going to matter if you're not sleeping. And you might say, well, six hours is enough, right? No, it's not. It's not and part of the reason that not enough is this is that your sleep isn't just this uniform thing. Where it's like the first six hours are the same as the second two hours are the first half and second half. There's deep sleep, and then there's REM sleep. REM sleep is most of your deep sleep that happens in the beginning. And then it kind of like flips as you get closer to the end. So deep sleep is way over something like deep sleep is for your body. And then REM sleep is for your brain. So deep sleep helps with tissue recovery. It helps with brain recovery. So when you sleep you actually get kind of like this bath, chemical and fluid that wicks out all the waste products from your brain. And this happens over the course of the night. This is in deep sleep. And you do have a REM sleep kind of interspersed in their bit, but it ramps up for the last two or so. hours of your sleep, which is why cutting out the last two hours. And in REM sleep we're learning. So you come in here and you practice says an overhand right and you're trying to get your overhead right, just right. And you're learning and he's giving you cues and you're practising and technique and it's gone great. And then you go home and you sleep six hours or you just lost that time when your brain would rewire. To do that better. You just cut it out. So you just spent all that time practising that technique to forget it for the next day. You're screwing yourself. It makes no sense. Also for sleep, how you want your environment to be pretty cool. So about 27 degrees at most, to make you sleep better, sleep quality is affected more by temperature than it is by light.

For optimum sleep, you want to have some sort of sleep schedule. So like I brush my teeth, I like to read for like 20 minutes, I meditate and then I pass on and I do that every night. This helps you sink into sleep faster. Avoid stuff that stresses you out.

The trouble with alcohol and sleep is you might say oh well I have a nightcap, I'll go to sleep that's what Yeah, but it's crappy sleep. It interferes with breath. Cannabis is the same thing. When you actually inhibit REM sleep.


## Cryotherapy, Massage & Meditation
Now we get into cryotherapy and foam rolling into meditation. So meditation is great because it de-stresses so you can devote more of your energy to recovering from training. Because you have a certain amount of stress you can handle it so it's like a bottle of water. Every time you do something stressful, whether it's training, whether it's a fight with your partner, whether it's your parents up your ass because why can't you get a real job instead of fighting. It's like the boss every time something happens. We let a little out for each thing and then eventually the bottles empty. That's it, you're done can't handle any more stress. So stress management is all about having less of that water poured into other things and more than your training and stretching and cryotherapy.


### Cryotherapy
If you're trying to get bigger, like grow muscle, don't do it within five hours of their workout. Because that's actually going to pull on the response to growing afterwards. After the four and a half, it's about four hours It doesn't seem to have an effect. So if you're going to do the cryotherapy doing about four or five hours, if you're doing it in water, it should be about 10 degrees Celsius. And it doesn't it doesn't have to be so hard right 10 degrees is fine. So make sure you move, because if you just sit still, but there's a little film of warmer water just collects around you. So you just got to move your legs and then you get the cold water back.


### Rolling & Massage
It's kind of cool because as humans are well, we're social creatures and it seems that we just respond to touch. So it can be a lacrosse ball, it can be a foam roller, and that seems to relax us. It's more psychological than anything but that matters, right? If we're talking about recovering and distressing Well, that's psychological stuff matters. If you're going to do it before the workout, do it before you stretch and your stretching should mostly be before the lifting itself or the training itself. Because this loosens up your muscles and gets you into those ranges you're trying so you know maybe if you're having trouble getting those head kicks, you need to stretch and hold on beforehand. Do that beforehand. Don't wait till afterwards. And your stretching should be you want to hold it 30-60 seconds. You don't want it to be a couple of minutes because then your muscles actually relax too much. And then you have a hard time generating a force. So if you're going to lift or if you're going to throw more kicks, your kicks won't be as hard if you're doing like multimodal stretches before because you're just too loose like a rubber band oversteps. The good news is that the effects of that are temporary. So if you stretch it's not like well now I'm doing the throw shade kicks for the rest of my career. Like now it's just that session is gonna be a little off.
