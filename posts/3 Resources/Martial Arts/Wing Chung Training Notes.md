# Wing Chung Training Notes

# Week 1

### 17/06/13 - Gan Sau Training
Practiced gan sau from mun sau, countering low punches.

-   LH low punch (gan, then punch IG)
-   LH low punch (gan) then LH cross (jum sau + punch IG)
-   LH low punch (gan) then RH low punch (step LH gan, RH pak sau the low punch and LH punch from OG)


### 19/06/13 - (Beginners induction)
Practised basics like creating stance, turning punches, how to move and pivot, how to keep correct distance when opponent is moving around.

Also how to use mun sau when opponent throws a straight punch through it (throw mun sau forward then pull the punch hand back and hold whilst punching with wu sau hand. Then drop wu sau hand to park opponents punching hand at the elbow and punch with mun sau hand)


### 21/06/13 - Lap Sau Training
Practised countering straight center punch with mun sau then did a lap sau punch from the OG (remember to twist hips when larping down in order to have more power).

We then practised a jum sau with wu sau hand and punch with mun hand. Next you can arrow step in to twist opponent and stamp on back of leg or sweep the leg.

Tip: when arrow stepping in here raise the elbow up from the jum sau hand in order do destabilise opponent and also open up his side.

::PRACTICE BOTH SIDES!::

We also did a bit of movement and turning around. Then practised arrow stepping forward and punching.


### 23/06/13 More Gan Sau
Practised more of what we did on Monday but incorporated more footwork and stepping in when doing the Gan and punch after the initial bride with mun sau.

Form China boxer learned to focus on keeping elbows down I order to sink shoulders. Also learned to focus on just firing the elbows when chain punching and the fore arm should be loose. Also need to pull back with the punch more in order to get more power but do not lean or extend shoulders when punching and also connect to target with bent arms not when fully extended.


# Week 2

### 24/06/13 - Practise for grading
Today we practised everything we need for the beginners grading, centerline punches, turning punches, arrow walking, circle stepping, gor sau (guards up against each other and moving around trying to keep the space and close opponents).


### 26/06/13 - last beginners induction
Today we went through moving 90 degrees to the opposite side of our mun sau I order to practise switching to the opposite leg as the lead leg and too learn to raise the wu sau hand as the mun sau.

We then practised this exercise with a partner and moved into them after pivoting round driving the mun sau onto their throat.

Finally we leaned bong lap sau and practised it.

TIP: for bong sau always bong when you feel the energy going against the mun sau and never raise your shoulder. Also corkscrew your hand forward when doing bong, never start it collapsed.


### 27/06/13 - First Intermediate class!
Need to practise extending out more with centerline punches. Also need to work on forward energy using bong during lok sau and resting shoulders.

During class we learned drill combos.

The order was:
-   Circle back and jum from the back leg
-   Circle to the other side and tan and punch (tan from the front leg).
-   Arrow step forward and tan and punch with the same hands.
-   Arrow backwards and bong lap sau incoming punch then finish with a jum. Then repeat.

Things to practise are jum from the back leg when circling backwards and bong from arrow stepping backwards. Also do not start bong collapsed as it’s a weak shape so practise throwing it forward more and using more forward energy.


### 28/06/13 - Beginner/Intermediate combos
Worked on punch combinations today combos were:

1.  Counter left jab (enemies left) with mun sau
2.  Counter low right punch with Gan Sau (turn mun sau into the Gan Sau) and step in + punch
3.  Counter left punch with high jum sau + punch
4.  Switch hands after punch and do a chop to the neck
5.  Then huen sau chop hand as a fuk sau then move guard hand to opponents shoulder and push down to lock arm and take opponent to the ground
6.  Follow up with a knee.

Remember to practise both sides


### 30/06/13 - Intermediate training with Gideon
Today we’re worked lots on lok sau and I need to remember to keep my elbows pinned to my sides like I’m holding a £50 note. Also remember to brush your hand on your chest as your doing the attack and power comes from the flip of the elbow.

We also did some boxing training so remember doing slips and covering distance.

As for intermediate training we did gor sau which I need to remember to sink in my stance. To counter a lap sau switch to a tan sau to counter a slap on the wrist change to a jum sau and if your close in after a lap sau on the opponent use the back elbow with the same back leg and do a lan say form the tricep of the opponent (lan sau is a lot like a slip from the back leg but you push your elbow up to brake opponents shape then push into him to knock him back.

As for gor sau training remember to cut opponents angles and use a low jum sau to control the center line, also remember to not switch feet when you do not need to, also don’t needlessly change guard hand too. Finally keep elbows down but not too close to the body In order to avoid getting trapped.


# Week 3

### 02/07/13 - Boxing with Dan
Today we worked a lot on understanding slipping and boxing in Dan’s class. We started with doing combinations on pads the n did it moving around and changing legs etc. And finally we incorporated some low kicks into the mix and mixed up the combinations.

We then dropped the pads and one person put on gloves. The person without gloves was practising pak sau on the glove (around the wrist area) to counter attacks and also slipping the punches. We then practised the same thing with moving around and started to incorporate counters (the person wearing gloves would counter the other person’s punches. The two counters we learned where to do a turning punch to the body (inside gate) and keeping guard hand up. The other was to twist to the outside gate and punch/jum over the person’s punch.

Practise slipping more and remember to keep your guard hands up! Also low front kicks to the groin are done with the front leg and connecting on the ankle or shin not the foot. Side kicks are done by bringing the back knee up then twisting the hips and driving the shin down into their leg.


### 07/07/13 - Gor Sau
Today we worked on more gor sau, practised countering a slap by twisting the wrist and also practised avoiding lap sau with a huen sau or a tan sau. Overall technique is getting better but I really need to sit in my stance more


# Week 4

### 08/08/13 - Beginner throws and intermediate tips
In the beginners class we were working on basic trapping fish a hand and lap sau and chop for the other hand, then after a few punches go deep in the opposite bicep to the one you laped and grasp opponents tricep from the inside and pull him forward and twist round keeping behind him as he hits the floor.

In intermediates, I learned I really need to work on my bong sau and shoulders keep popping up or twisting round. Keep in mind to keep square and sink in stance then keep practising on keeping elbows down and not rising with the bong also keep checking in not turning to much.

As for gor sau I learned that if I’m collapsed and not doing well use a jum sau from the cutting through line to collapse his front and gain the center line.
