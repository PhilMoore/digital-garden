### Sword and Dagger
We practised angle 1-12 with Sword and dagger. After every 2 attacks with the sword you attack with the dagger.


### Sword Dagger 6 Steps Drill
Can be done with any combination even open hand.
1.  Sword in shieth position like kendo (legs neutral - Step female triangle to opposite side of sword and perform drawing sword block. Use dagger to check the enemies angle 4 and push it away out of the center.
2.  Take a quick and small one-two step to the side leading with the opposite foot to the hand holding the sword and feed a wide angle 1 (from the form).
3.  Circle pivot lead foot around and perform a dagger and sword block downwards (like a double low gaan sau but your hands are rail plane not wall plane.
4.  Take a step forward with sword leg and feed a straight down the center attack aiming for the head (kendo men strike).
5.  Do the turn step punch move from wing Chung and use the side of the sword to block attack then tuck around behind shoulder (angle 1 heaven deflection move) and keep dagger close to chest. As the sword is under the shoulder stab with blade hand (should be over the other hand.
6.  Just an angle 4 attack from the main form.

This can be done with 2 people. 1 person performs steps 1-3 while oponent performs steps 4-6.

As mentioned above this can be done with any combination of weapons or open hand. It just needs to be modified slightly the but idea applies.
