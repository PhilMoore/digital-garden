Client Brief

I am wanting to discuss creating a web link or form that I can have as a shortcut on all examiners iPads with there log ins for each guy .
My ideal Setu up is to create my own link for it .
Please find attached a mock up of template for our updated PPI checklist   . (This is not completed as our t&c exclusions & important info will be added and few updates to questions list)
Few notes I would like to make regarding this project is we require a tick list option so tick cross or na
I also want to have the option maybe a drop down when the examiners select tick it has a drop down option of pre worded texts to choose from to add to
The comments section of the report , Same if they select x a list of options pop up that they can select from and slightly edit if need be ,
This is to speed up the process and offer our customers a detailed comments on each component checked. We would like 1 main photo for the summery page which the examiners can
Taker on arrival Maybe first question then vehicle info .
I was also wanting to build it where the overall summary/comments section automatically adds the X  items selected during the inspection to it
I would also require Maybe the last few pages to be photo gallery section where our team will have a minimum required photos to be added ,
So I would like it to say this to remind and allow camera to pop up must be compulsory for the form to be completed

Photos to note attention to
I will also have they examiners taking photos of the faults they find either pointing or circling the fault in picture this will be throughout the inspection and they will attach to the email
Separately to the above required photos
There will be a few more questions to be added like is the vehicle on the PPSR register , if they tick X gives 3 drop down options of (which will also add to summary section when ticked
1. PLEASE NOTE THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN RECORDED ON THE WRITTEN OFF REGISTER REFER TO PPSR REPORT FOR FURTHER INFO
2. PLEASE NOTE THIS VEHICLE HAS A SECURITY ENCUMBRANCE AGAINST IT   REFER TO PPSR REPORT FOR FURTHER INFO
3. PLEASE NOTE THIS VEHICLE HAS A STOLEN REPORT AGAINST IT REFER TO PPSR REPORT FOR FURTHER INFO
I am happy to work together with you and my design artist Josh who can creat the layout and design to suit the content. I can provide all the drop down content for each item when required let me know.
If this is possible and my options to this is available I would like to have a section  where when we select a particular dropdown maybe as a code RWC  this sends the item checked and  comments to a section that says
Safety certificate items that require attention .
```

I just want to clarify a couple of thing about how you want this to work:
Do you want this to be a form on the website which the examiners fill out there?

Do you want the examiners to have to log in to access this page?
Or perhaps just have a password protected page that they can each enter the same password to access?

Where do you want the form data to go to?
Send to an asap email?
Create a PDF that can be saved / sent to the customer?

Do you want this information to pass into servicem8 at all?

As i know we have discussed this before and getting the data to produce a PDF or passing in to servicem8 is where it gets a bit more complicated!

a web form would definitely be the easiest option if you are happy for the form data to be sent in an email.

There are a few options for creating a PDF from either a web form or adding a link to the PDF form. These would all require a PDF generator paid service.

some services which will allow your team to easily enter information for a Pre-Purchase and have that exported or directly sent to the customer as a PDF.

[https://www.platoforms.com/](https://www.platoforms.com/) - Free to $12/mo
[https://www.pdffiller.com/](https://www.pdffiller.com/) - $9 to $30/mo
[https://www.jotform.com/products/pdf-editor/features/](https://www.jotform.com/products/pdf-editor/features/) - Free to $24/mo

There are also a few options to create the PDF directly from a web-form.

which would be between $100 - 200 per year (so comparable to the above PDF options - and will allow us to customise the form & PDF output appearance better)

I have contacted the web-form PDF options to clarify if it will be possible with the fields we need, and to email the PDF rather than Just save or download it.

Let me know the details on the points above so I can figure out how to best set this up!
