  

## Reasons why project has gone wrong.

1.  We quoted on a design that was not set in place.

1.  The design has shifted drastically by what we initially thought we were creating.
2.  We created pages in Figma which where initially loved and later hated and had to be redone.
3.  We ended up spending 5+ hours per section on the homepage as that's what it took to get right.
4.  Was a lot of confusion around design at the start
5.  Branding was never finalised leading to issues later on.
6.  We should have approached it with a better choice of

1.  design in all breakpoints
2.  review
3.  sign off
4.  build

3.  1+ Months were used for experimentation to try and understand the concept of the design the client wanted. E.g. not boxes, use boxes but only a little bit, etc.
4.  Also, colours were never great to start with leading to issues with colour pairs
5.  The Colour pallet was too vast and we had to incorporate it all in a different colour theme per page which was never in the initial scope.
6.  Uncertainty on control of design, can we just put our foot down and say no? We've been accommodating to the client however this has led to bad design and longer timelines

  

## Lessons Learned from this project

-   Any custom project on Webflow needs to be fully designed in Figma before webflow work begins.

-   This design must be approved by the client

-   Client feedback on changing sections completely after starting the webflow work will drastically delay the project and add cost.
-   Branding must be set in stone before we start webflow work ideally even before the Figma stage.
-   We need to communicate with the client weekly

-   At the start of each week what we look to accomplish
-   At end of what was done and any pain points.
