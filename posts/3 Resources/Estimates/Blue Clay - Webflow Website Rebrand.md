# Branding

Some guidance and [inspo here:](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Um3B6Y2M-y4Wp5LkIUDAjE1nN6gqsPGi?usp=sharing)

minimal modern popart style

A combination of Landscape - Portrait and Popart style inspiration.

Logo

More abstract version of the Labyrinth, -Pull it back to basics and thicken out the Lines, Mostly focusing on the B an C lines but thicker. (C can be a backwards C too).

Typography

Main fonts, thick bold, Blocky, in logo include “Blue Clay Content Strategists”

big bold typography

Font cant date, cant be dated already and must be easy to read. If its a heading font, one that’s easily available.

Heading and body fonts need to be acessable to all devices/browsers for loading presentations etc, clean but can also be a bit fun.

Alternate font options for this.

Universal fonts for presentations & cross wondows / mac documents

[Common fonts to all versions of Windows & Mac equivalents (Browser safe fonts) - Web design tips & tricks](https://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html)

Suggestion:

Make a bunch of generic re-usable slide titles in a custom font and save as images?

Then at least you can have ome kind of brand consistency with this?

Colours

Vibrant /warm colours

ocean / city / nature

brighen up p13 (on canva doc)

Teal colour needs to be a bit more vibrant. Watermelon colour too.
