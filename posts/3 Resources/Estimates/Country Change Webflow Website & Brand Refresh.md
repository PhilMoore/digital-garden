# Country Change Webflow Website & Brand Refresh

# Website

**Option 1:**

Stay on wordpress

Create staging site and then migrate

use elementor pro


**Option 2:**

Migrate to webflow

As long as urls and paths stay the same for pages nothing should be affected.

If files such as PDF's are shared anywhere, this would be affected as the location of these files will have changed.

In this and any other case where the url or path must change, redirects will be made so that those links still go somewhere (to the new version of the page)

CMS migration will be done through a csv - need to look into how this will work

**Blog post dates:**

Youâ€™ll need to import the dates into a new field. The created/publish date fields are read-only.

See

[CSV import: no date mapping possible? 45](https://discourse.webflow.com/t/csv-import-no-date-mapping-possible/51097/9?u=samliew)

[File Download on Form Submission](https://discourse.webflow.com/t/file-download-on-form-submission/1414)

Modal popups for content showing on CMS town pages.

Make a modal SYMBOL. have the interactions on elements within the symbol ONLY.

This should work on all instances of the symbol accross different pages.

**Option 3:**

Stay on wordpress

use a staging plugin such as [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/)

so that we don't have to use a subdomain and then transfer. (avoid having to edit server side files & potential conflicts when transferring)

Country Change Website Refresh

We would love to move the website away from wordpress.

While wordpress can be a great way to get a project off the ground, it comes with a lot of trade offs which add unnessecary complications for simple functions or design choices, which really limit growth and flexibility in the long term.

**Our Proposal**

We think the right direction will be to move the website from wordpress to webflow with CMS management.

**Why Webflow? Why not stay with Wordpress?**

Webflow allows a fully custom design without the need for plugins, themes, page builders required by wordpress.

All of these which all add layers of unnessecary code to your website and can even conflict with each other adding duplicated code or even conflicting with one another which can cause problems, all impact the loading speed of your website, and all need constant updates to ensure your site stays fully functioning and secure.

A huge drawback of wordpress' plugin reliance is that they need to be updated by their developers to ensure they keep working. If any of these goes un-supported in the future then this could leave you with a core function or feature which simply no longer works, or poses a security risk if it is not updated.

On webflow we can truly re-design your website without limitations on design layout, or basic functionaily such as forms and popups being dictated by plugins.

Webflow has a great Contant Management System which will allow a site like Country Change to truly shine.

We can work a lot of the website and directories into CMS systems, not only the blog posts!

**Potential CMS uses:**

Blogs

Custom Blog views (custom blog views for towns)

Town Pages

we could potentially add tags making town pages filterable depending on what someone is looking for.. e.g someone is interested in a country change to an area with an XYZ community, or industry? filter by tags to find your perfect town.

Testimonials

Case Studies

And a great bonus is that the content and images can be edited and added by anyone with access without any risk of altering the core website or page layout.

e.g spotted a typo? No worries! jump in and edit it!, Need to update an LGA's contact info, easy!

What's the risk in switching?

The mian risk in switching to another platform or even refreshing a website while staying on the same platform is the possibility that SEO rankings will be affected.

The main reasons this happens is:

1.  the page links change
2.  the page content changes
3.  the page layout changes

These all contribule to how google & other search engines find, index and rate your website.

The biggest thing to pay attention to is the page links (URLS) and sitemap.

Since when these change, it's like changing address so the expected location is different.

So, we will keep them the same! If we copy exactly the link structure then this impact will be very minimal.

And if any links have to change, and for example, perhaps somehing was linked in an article or blog post elsewhere and we need to make sure people can still find it if the link changes, we will create a redirect in these cases. But it's best to avoid doing this or keep it to a minimum if possible.

Most likely in our case these will need to be put in place for documents like PDF's that were hosted on the wordpress website, just incase they have been linked elsewere.

Preserving access is key!
