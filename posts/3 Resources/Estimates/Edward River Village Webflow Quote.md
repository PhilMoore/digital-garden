# Edward River Village New Website Build

  

## Platform Suggestion:

  

Webflow

[https://webflow.com/](https://webflow.com/)

  

CMS Site plan: USD $23 /mo billed yearly

A CMS plan allows us to create template pages and collections of information to display in whatever way we wish.

  

So great for displaying info pages for unit types.

  

Includes editor function: 

If you wish we can add a log in for you to edit the site’s text, and images or add cms content like blogs without having to access the backend - so no fear of interfering or breaking anything accidentally!

  

Building from a template: 

Building the site from a template to cut on time and cost required vs a fully custom build.

  

Picking one that is a good starting point or base to build upon is recommended. This Estimate assumes that a template will be used.

  

A template can be fully edited, customized, and added to however we need to and to fit with your branding (not locked into any styles or features regardless of what you choose). 

  

Initial template suggestions: $49 - 79 USD
