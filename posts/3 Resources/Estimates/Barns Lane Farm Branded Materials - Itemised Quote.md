Notepad - what did you want here? Lined or blank?

**I think blank.**

What envelope size? [Sizes can be found here...](https://auspost.com.au/sending/send-within-australia/compare-letter-services/regular-letters-cards)

**Just a standard letter size. ::DL::**

Also, can you please confirm the details you want on each of the items:

e.g. Letterhead:

Company Name **Yes**

ABN **No**

Postal Address **PO Box 3146, Newmarket 4051**

Physical address **39 Barns Lane, Coolum Beach**

Email and phone? If so, do you have a general phone number? I can recommend getting a 1300 or 1800 number or landline that you divert to your mobile perhaps? **Its not a bad idea – but lets leave phone number off for now, except our signatures and just use mobile.**

Thinking into the future for events, dining, products and accommodation there's a lot of other things they might need but really depends what their needs are and where they are in their businesses development.

Here's a few things off the top of my head:

-   Info brochures (orchid gardens, gin distillery, accommodation info for guests)

-   presentation folders would be useful for guest accommodation info folders in rooms etc

-   Menus
-   Map of the grounds
-   Gift certificates
-   Product Labels (they have a gin distillery?)
