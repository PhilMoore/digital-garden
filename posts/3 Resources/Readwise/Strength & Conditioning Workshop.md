## Highlights
- if you're not strong, you can't be powerful. By definition, you can't be powerful if you're not strong. Because power is mass times distance over time (Page 1)
- the bulk of your strength work is going to be with a bar. So think squat, deadlift, bench press rows (Page 1)
- So let's break conditioning down. There are basically two parts to aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic just means that you're using oxygen. Anaerobic means no oxygen. Aerobic is lower intensity, anaerobic is higher intensity (Page 1)
- For aerobic capacity, you're going to do a lot of road work jogging, cycling or running. So when you're working on aerobic capacity (which is all about training your heart), you're making your heartbeat at about 150 beats a minute. You're gonna keep it there for 30 to 90 minutes. So the longer you have before your flight, the more towards the 90-minute end. The shorter your flight is the closer to 30min you want to go. The important thing here is 30-90 minutes at zone 2 and that's it (Page 1)
- To train aerobic power means going hard for 60 to 120 seconds and then the rest up till your heart rate it's 130bpm. That way You are fresh so that you can then go nice and hard again round after round. If you’re not as rested you're basically just wasting energy because you're not going as hard as you could (Page 1)
- Now let's go anaerobic, what this means is that you can operate at a higher percentage, higher intensity for longer so you can give your all going for the submission, all that good stuff. You're producing that really high force for a longer amount of time. This is the stuff that really really sucks. Right in the sense that your lungs are gonna burn your muscles are gonna burn and you're gonna want to throw up
