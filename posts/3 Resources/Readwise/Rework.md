## Highlights
- When you let customers outgrow you, you’ll most likely wind up with a product that’s basic—and that’s fine. Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There’s an endless supply of customers who need exactly that
- there are always more people who are not using your product than people who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board
