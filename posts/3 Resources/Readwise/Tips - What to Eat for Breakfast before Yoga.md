## Highlights
- A bowl of oatmeal is a great idea for breakfast before yoga. Oatmeal is known for being rich in fibers and are slow digesting carbs, providing sustained energy and fulfilling your appetite for a longer time. Additionally, add a bit of cinnamon to enhance your oatmealâ€™s taste. Whatever you eat, try to finish it at least 20-30 minutes before getting on the mat.
