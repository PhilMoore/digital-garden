### Top 5 mistakes

One page one goal

Action colour - the brightest and most attention grabbing colour. (Reserve for the most important things and use it only for that) always have a secondary action colour. It could be the same colour just have the box white and make the text the same colour as the box)

White space is essential for a balanced harmonious layout. (The less you have the better the interaction) (more white space = more premium)

Navigation should be well structured and simple. (Never have more then 7 options)


## Jubril Agoro -

Ebates - cash back store / referral thing for affiliate marketing.

Social media accounts are important for all business.

Tips: the way to set up the deal with the customer is - take revenue of the ad spend based on conversions

Facebook ad certification - costs 200 USD
